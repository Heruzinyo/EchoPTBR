"O Rio Yeeyah abastece o Lago Emma pelo norte."
"É mais difícil de chegar do que no próprio lago, mas ele tem algumas clareiras agradáveis ao longo de sua margem."
"Uma delas tem alguns bancos e uma churrasqueira pública enferrujada-pra-caramba que eu tenho certeza que ninguém a usa há décadas."
"Esse é o lugar para onde vamos."
"Ao sairmos da van do Leo, eu decido fazer algumas filmagens do lago imediatamente."
"Ela não terá muita presença no final, então acho que vou narrar sobre ela mais tarde." # no final?
"O verdadeiro lago fica a apenas alguns minutos a pé daqui."
"É um pouco difícil navegar entre os arbustos de sálvia, e eu sei que terei que verificar por carrapatos mais tarde."

"Estou ficando desconfortável com a ideia de segurar essa câmera enquanto navego por esse terreno."
"Provavelmente teria sido melhor se o Leo tivesse estacionado o carro ao lado do reservatório enquanto eu saía para filmar, mas acho que mesmo assim isso não estaria tudo bem."
"Agora, há uma grande praça pavimentada ao lado do estacionamento, vários bancos, e uma fileira de churrasqueiras novas."
"Várias lâmpadas também foram instaladas na área."
"Leo tinha razão sobre a tentativa da cidade de transformar o reservatório em um local de recreação."
"De fato eu vejo alguns jatinhos passando pela água, deixando longos rastros de branco atrás deles."
"Há até o que parece ser um tipo de felino pescando nas águas rasas."
"Isso explicaria como o hotel ainda está funcionando."
"O Lago Emma é relativamente pequeno, com apenas dezenove quilômetros de comprimento e oito de largura."
"Eu olho em volta antes de subir ao topo de uma colina próxima para fazer minhas filmagens."
"Mesmo com algumas pessoas lá, ainda é bem quieto, além das buzinas dos trens, e é um pouco assustador."
"Eu termino e começo a voltar rapidamente."
"É difícil explicar por que estou com medo em plena luz do dia com pessoas ao redor."
"Deve ser por causa do que aconteceu há muitos anos atrás, ou eu só estou delirando."

"Fico feliz em ouvir as vozes dos meus amigos novamente à medida que me aproximo... Mas então, parece que eles estão brigando."

f "— Então eu deveria ir embora, porra?"
"Parece muito mais sério do que nossos bate-bocas comuns, então eu acelero o passo."
"Eles parecem se aquietar um pouco quando me veem chegando."
"TJ está ao lado, olhando para o rio, e ocasionalmente jogando uma pedra nele."
"Carl se senta em uma cadeira, uma das seis que foram colocadas em um semicírculo."

m "— Ei, hum, eu vou ir dar um mergulho. Faz um tempo que eu não entro na água."
"When we first got here I was completely disappointed to find that the motel didn't have its own swimming pool."
"Being an otter, I usually like to swim at LEAST once a day, if not more."
"It's been three days, and I'm feeling antsy as hell for it.."
"Flynn finally turns around, a beer in his hand as he cracks it open."
"It was true that he'd been acting a bit strange today."
"He'd held the entire trip up by a few hours, and when he'd finally shown up his eyes were bleary, and he seemed sluggish, like he'd been up all night."
"When we'd asked if he was alright, he brushed us off."

"We're currently in the middle of a drought that has lasted the past three years, so the water is low...only about ten feet at its deepest."
"It's enough though and God.. it feels good. It's spring, so the water is pretty cold."

"Eventually I settle on drifting to the bottom, laying and gripping on to the rocky floor as I stare up at the shimmery light above me."
"I feel the gentle current run over my body."
"It's nice to be away from all that tension above me. I feel isolated, alone, and for now, that feels good." 
"Only I could really come down this deep, the others not being able to hold their breath as long, or being too little."
"I remember when we were younger I would give the others \"rides\" around the lake, able to swim for nearly half a mile and back."
"Even Flynn the asshole had done it a few times. It was one skill I had that I was proud of, even if it was inherent to my species."
"It still made me somehow useful or at least different from everyone else...in a good way."
"I had always felt like the odd one out in the group, as strange as it sounds."
"Where everyone else has a strong, distinct personality, I was just.. average?"
"Sometimes I wonder if they were just friends with me because we all had to be when we were younger."
"This whole trip has kinda forced me to think back on all the memories I have of this place, and my friends."
"They were always doing the cool things, being different, while I just sort of blended into the background."
"Even then I wanted to DO something, to stand out somehow..."
"That's...that's what I'm trying to do here...I guess..."
"It's been about seven minutes, and I only know that because that's about as long as I can hold my breath."

"For a second, I wonder if everyone is just gone."
"Of course, that's ridiculous and, as I come over the embankment, everyone's there."
"Predictably, Flynn didn't get my food out, so I go to the cooler to grab a sandwich and soda before sitting in an empty chair next to Leo."
"Apparently it was a good idea to bring lawn chairs, considering the tables looked like they were covered in a year's worth of bird shit."
f "\"How was the swim?\""
"His tone is bitter and salty."
"He's not in his usual grumpy, but good-natured mood. He's genuinely unhappy."

"Flynn can obviously tell that he might have a fight on his hands, though, and it's clear he doesn't want that."
"He drops his shoulders, seeming to shrink, as if invisible strings that had been holding him up were cut. He turns to us, then gestures at TJ."
