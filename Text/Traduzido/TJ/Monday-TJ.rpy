"Eu estou realmente preocupado com o TJ."
"Ele é um cara sensível e, depois de uma chicotada daquelas de alguém como o Flynn... Eu não consigo imaginar o estado em que ele está."
"Eu não o vejo em lugar nenhum enquanto examino a área, mas vejo algumas árvores e arbustos mais acima ao longo da margem do rio."
"Já que não há nenhum outro lugar para se esconder, eu presumo que seja lá que ele esteja."

"Sem dúvidas, eu o vejo imediatamente. Ele está sentado, com os joelhos levantados e os braços cruzados sobre eles."
"Ele está com a testa apoiada em cima dos braços, encarando a areia entre as pernas."
"Fico parado por um momento, pensando se não seria melhor deixá-lo sozinho."
"Depois de alguns segundos eu finalmente decido me sentar ao lado dele, com as pernas cruzadas."

"O vento aumenta, os reflexos do rio destacam as gotículas de poeira que se espalham ao nosso redor." # gotículas???
"O pelo do seu rosto está um pouco bagunçado, com algumas pontas espetadas por estar molhado."
"É uma visão incomum de ver seu pelo desgrenhado."

m "\"I mean, I can't believe he's doing this...\""
"I trace a claw through the dirt, drawing some wavy patterns as I try to make sense of all this myself."
m "\"I think it's just because he was such good friends with Sydney, and he just wants more than the truth.\""
"I look sideways at TJ."

m "\"And I guess you were the only one that saw him...saw what happened...so he only has you to go after.\""

t "\"Well maybe...\""
"His voice cracks and he looks away from me again, wiping at his face."
t "\"...Maybe I haven't told him everything because I don't want him to have those images in his head.\""
"TJ takes a moment to steady his voice, working to get his breathing back to normal."
t "\"I just...I just wish I could go back to that day.\""
m "\"TJ...there's nothing you could have done.\""
"I know my words are meaningless crap, and I hate myself for saying them."
"But I have to say something."
m "\"Not one of us would have been able to do anything if we were there.\""
t "\"You would have.\""
m "\"Well...\""
t "\"Besides, I already know I couldn't have saved him on my own. That isn't what...\""
"TJ takes a moment to wipe his face again and when he's done he doesn't go on."
"We sit in silence for a long while after that, and I adjust myself so that I can lean back against a rock behind me."
"I pat the ground."

"I pick up a few pebbles and toss them into the river."
m "\"Remember when we used to call it Seesaw River?\""
t "\"Yeah...\""
"He leaves it at that, so I drop it."
"I rest my head back and close my eyes, only then realizing how tired I am."
"In some way, I can see why Flynn is so suspicious, or at least why he believes there's more to the story."
"There clearly is."
"But while I do want TJ to tell me more about what happened, I could never bring myself to ask him."
"I honestly feel that if I ever want to help him with his past, I should probably come to terms with it myself."
"I crinkle my brow, toying with the idea of going back..."
"It's something I actively avoid thinking about. We all do."
"But like Jenna said, maybe talking about it, {i}thinking{/i} about it, might actually help."
"I dig my fingers into the pebbles on either side of me."
"The images come in a quick flurry, like someone cycling through a View-Master too fast."
