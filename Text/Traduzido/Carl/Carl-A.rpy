"Is history subjective in nature?"
"The story of James and John sure seems to be."
"All we have are a few written letters and from these we must try to draw some sort of conclusion."
"In the end, it can't really be said what exactly happened almost 150 years ago."
"Instead, we can only provide the facts:"
"Several Native children went missing, James was accused of the crime before claiming that his secret lover, John, was the culrpit."
"In his jail letters, Johnathon claims that he was framed by James."
"Because of the vigilante justice dealt out by the town, John never had a trial, and no record of the evidence collected exists."
"James, because of his influence, was allowed to leave and live hundreds of miles away on the West Coast where he eventually died."
"He never wrote of the incident again."
"Many believe that, as journalists, we're supposed to be unbiased and only state facts."
"That's not exactly true, as long as it's clear that we're stating an opinion."
"So I'd like to do that now."
"It's my opinion that John is innocent."
"We should be presumed innocent until proven guilty, after all, and Johnathon has never even had that chance."
"According to accounts written by other townspeople, James was a deceitful and emotionally manipulative man."
"There are many accounts of his prejudices against the Native people."
"In the end, the records that exist of John give us no reason to disbelieve him—"
"—While James has given us every reason to doubt him."
"But because time is evidence's worst enemy - it has been 150 years - the definitive answer will likely never be known."
"Like much of Echo, the story is lost to time."
"I'm Chase Hunter at Pueblo University, and this has been a special report on the town of Echo."

"It's weird, writing the last word to a script I started almost one-and-a-half years ago."
"It's changed a lot since then, moving from a focus on hysteria to an old mansion mystery."
"My mind wanders back to that spring break in Echo."
"I still shake my head when I think about it, how it completely shattered my view on reality, my view on life."
"Of course, I couldn't come back to school right afterwards; I hadn't finished my project after all, heh."
"Actually, I needed therapy."
"We all did."
"...Except Carl, he seemed to have come out of it better than he had been going into it...somehow."
"\"Everyone handles trauma differently\" Jenna would say."
"In fact, she has a lot of things to say about what happened."
"While she didn't come out quite as unscathed as Carl, she's still tougher than me, and actually went right back to school that summer."
"Now she's at Weston and a lot of her research is focused on folie à deux, or shared psychosis."
"Because of how everything went down, the things we felt and what we saw, Jenna's convinced that that's what took place."
"She brought up the way we primed each other to hear and see things."
"The way the things we saw didn't seem to have any rhyme or reason for what they were."
"While I do believe a lot of what we saw came from ourselves, I'm not fully convinced that explains all of it."
"Mainly because the rest of the townspeople went through their own nightmare that night."
"I still can't believe the things that Leo and TJ went through."
"Still, I'm glad she can find a way to explain it to herself."
"She told me over the phone just last week that she hasn't forgiven herself, that she should have been stronger than that."
"I've told her over and over that it's not her fault, but I guess after coming to with a knife in her hand and her friend stabbed..."
"...it left an impression."
"I rest my hand on the thick scar through my shirt that runs all the way down my back and wiggle the ankle that causes me a permanent limp."
"Still, this whole incident, it actually brought us closer."
"At least for Jenna, Carl, and I."
"Hell, even Raven."
"It's still painful to think about how Flynn, Leo, and TJ...poor TJ, aren't really talking anymore."
"I guess it's the fact that we went through completely different things during the...incident."
"Of course, we'd told the police that it was someone else that had stabbed me while the town descended into madness."
"Echo, a name now famous worldwide after the mass hysteria incident that truly brought a dying town to it's ultimate end."
"At least in terms of being a failed town."
"While no one really lives there now, it's certainly become a tourist attraction."
"Countless news reports, TV shows, and \"paranormal investigators\" descended on the area."
"Especially once the news story changed from \"Spree Killings Leave Nine Dead\" to \"Whole Town Went Nuts\"."
"Luckily, not a lot of focus fell on us since we weren't exactly living in Echo anymore."
"We just got into the ambulances and left."
"Carl, on the other hand, along with the rest of his family, are still harassed by the media."
"Carl's mom, Trisha, is a pro at handling the media though."
"I still wonder about what exactly it was that stopped her from publishing all her findings."
"I'll have to ask her sometime considering I'm practically family due to how much I visit with Carl."
"In the end, the relationship that I had with Carl in the dreamscape didn't exactly survive in the real world."
"Carl told me that he didn't know where he ended and James began, even when he rejected James' influence."
"We couldn't really trust anything that happened there."
"But still, he's my best friend and I plan to spend the summer over at his house when I start my next project on Echo."
"Yeah, I realized that there are a lot more stories to cover over there, and I plan to uncover them."
"It's almost healing going back now without any fear."
"My own little therapy."
"Guess I always end up back there eventually..."
"The sound of clops to my right makes me look up just as a bulky ram fills the frame of the doorway."
