"There isn't much to go off of."
"After reading through it I'm pretty skeptical of \"Haunted Echo\", the main source of my documentary."
"At least the bit of information I just came across references some newspaper articles from 1952."
"The young wolf named Robert Smith wasn't even a resident of Echo."
"He'd been resting at the Echo Classification Yard after taking a train from the capitol."
"He was on his way to the West Coast and, once he thought he'd found the right train, he attempted to board it."
"No one knows exactly what happened."
"Yet somehow, his train hopping went horribly wrong and he was found with both limbs severed two hours later."
"He'd managed to crawl twenty yards north up along the rail before he was found."
"Somehow, impossibly, he survived the ordeal up to that point."
"This was mainly due to the mud packs that had been placed on the stumps, halting the bleeding."
"Of note was the fact that Robert had seemingly become delirious because of the blood loss, pain, or trauma."
"Likely a combination of all three, actually."
"He claimed that the bleeding had been stopped by a creature of some kind."
"When he tried to describe it he began to sob and scream incoherently."
"It's hard to say how much of this is being exaggerated by the author."
"Either way, I don't exactly have time to track down all of her sources, so I decide I'll just have to trust it."
"My leg jumps as something soft and ticklish brushes up against it."
"I snap my gaze up at Leo."

"It's unlikely that Robert would have survived anyway, due to the extent of his injuries and infection."
"Still, it is of note that he ended up committing suicide a few hours after discovery."
"He apparently slipped out the fifth floor window of the Payton Regional Medical Center."
"Though authorities simply dismissed it as a case of a man knowing that his demise was nigh and finishing the job himself—"
"—the author speculates it had something to do with the horrors he saw on the tracks."

"He, of course, insists on paying for everything."
"I'm not really sure when Leo became so concerned with how I perceive his income."
"I don't mind, though. The meal is good and I'm happy not to pay the $30 price tag."
"It does remind me of his job, though, so I ask him about his schedule,."
"He says his parents gave him the entire week off, which surprises me."
"I remember how Leo worked almost everyday in that shop. I guess his dad is just mellowing out with age."

m "\"That sounds great, Leo, but to get back together, that's like setting ourselves up for another breakup and I don't want to do that.\""
l "\"But then we'd know for sure. Without parents, or school in the way.\""
l "\"It'll just be us and then, even if it doesn't work out, there's some closure there.\""
"For the first time I feel myself seeing things from Leo's point of view. I'm not necessarily losing anything by at least trying."
"And he's right; there really wasn't any closure, mostly because of me."
"Leo must sense my indecision, because he immediately presses forward."
