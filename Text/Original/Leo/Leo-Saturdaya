"Leo wakes me up early the next day, telling me he had to settle some stuff with his dad at the shop."
"I don't get much of a chance to ask why or for how long before he's out the door, yelling something about food being in the fridge."
"I immediately fall back asleep though and the next time I open my eyes it's two hours later."
"A text from Leo half an hour ago tells me that he's still at the shop but would be back soon."
"I lay around for another twenty minutes, browsing through a few sites before finally sitting up with a sigh."
"One day left to do the project."
"I'm so far behind, though, that I'm not even feeling any anxiety about it at this point, sort of just resigned."
"I should have known better, really, that I wasn't gonna get anything done with all of my old friends around."
"I stare at the wall for a while longer before I force myself to sit up."
"No use sitting around. I might not be making my best project, but it didn't mean I couldn't do a few things to make it less terrible."
"Food momentarily crosses my mind, but I shrug it off; I'd never been a breakfast person anyway."
"As soon as I leave the house I notice things are a bit off."
"Firstly it's dead quiet. Usually there was some kind of drone, whether it was the wind or a plane overhead, there was usually something."
"No sound of birds either, and those were always chirping in the morning."
"I stand in the doorway for a bit, feeling a vague sense of tension, electricity in the air."
"Something building..."
"I shake my head, feeling dizzy."
"That dream last night had fucked me up in all kinds of ways, so it's not surprising that it's probably still messing with me in the day."
"I'll be glad to be gone from this place tomorrow."
"Some rustling next door draws my attention and I see Kudzu, carrying a set of clippers walk across his front yard."
"I open my mouth to say hi, but I hold back, feeling self-conscious."
"His brooding nature was a bit intimidating and I don't know if he's the kind of person who expects a greeting, or not."
"I'm not left to wonder long, though, because he spots me almost immediately and raises a hand."
ku "\"Morning.\""
m "\"Oh, hey there.\""
"He grunts before setting his attention on a bush in front of him, sizing it up."
"I stand there awkwardly for a bit longer, wondering if that was the end of our exchange, but he speaks up again."
ku "\"Leo take off?\""
"He nods his head at the empty driveway."
m "\"Oh yeah, he did earlier this morning.\""
"I walk down from the porch and walk over to the edge of Leo's lawn so it doesn't feel like we're yelling at each other."
m "\"Said something about having to take care of business with his dad.\""
ku "\"I see...\""
"Kudzu stops trimming and looks up at me before smiling."
ku "\"You can come on my lawn. It's not like I have an electric fence or anything."
"Looking down I see that I'm toing the edge of his immaculate lawn on Leo's side, looking like a little kid."
"I blush before stepping over to crunch along the adobe colored gravel he had set out."
"It's weird how nice it all is, especially compared to the shitty trailer sitting in the middle of it all."
m "\"This all looks really nice. I guess gardening is your hobby?\""
ku "\"Thanks.\""
"Kudzu snips at the bush rather aggressivel."
ku "\"I like it. It's what I do most of the day.\""
"The raccoon moves to the side of the bush, examining it."
ku "\"It's peaceful.\""
"He gives the bush another snip before resting a hand on his hip while he lets the clippers dangle in the other."
ku "\"And it keeps you in shape.\""
"I couldn't argue with that. Although he was skinny, the muscle showed through the fur on his arms."
"He was probably the most in-shape guy I'd seen in Echo."
"I quickly snap my eyes back to his but he's already smirking."
"I worry he's about to point out that he'd caught me, but instead he gestures at my camera bag with his clippers."
ku "\"Gonna do something for your project?\""
m "\"Ah, yeah, need to get a bit more film before I leave tomorrow.\""
"The skinny raccoon wipes his forehead with a forearm."
ku "\"Anything in particular?\""
"I think."
m "\"Not really. Just old things to show the town's age.\""
"Kudzu sticks the clippers into the ground, looking up as he thinks."
ku "\"I know of a few things...you go to the old school?\""
m "\"Yeah, was headed there, actually.\""
ku "\"Then there's the ruins next to the lake.\""
m "\"Yeah, was gonna wait for Leo to drive me there later today.\""
ku "\"Other than that there's an old rusted pump up the road, but I don't know if that's actually from Echo's earlier days.\""
m "\"Couldn't hurt to look. Where is it, exactly?\""
"Kudzu points over my shoulder, up the road."
ku "\"Down past Duke's house, right before the convenience store."
ku "\"It's kinda hidden back in some brush, but I can take you there.\""
m "\"Oh, if it's no trouble.\""
ku "\"It's fine. I've got plenty of time to do this today.\""
m "\"Well, alright. Thanks.\""
"I shift the bag on my shoulder and stand to the side as Kudzu tosses down the clippers then starts towards the road."
"I follow him quietly, again feeling awkward under his no-nonsense attitude."
ku "\"So you and Leo getting along?\""
m "\"Yeah. We're having fun.\""
ku "\"Good...he's been looking forward to this week for a while now. Wouldn't shut up about it last week.\""
"I'm somewhat surprised that it's Kudzu filling the silence between us."
"Not that I mind. He's pretty damn good at it."
"I smile."
m "\"Yeah...that's Leo. He really misses our old pack.\""
"Kudzu huffs a laugh."
ku "\"Wolves.\""
"I agree."
m "\"Wolves.\""
"As we walk I can smell the heavy musk coming from the raccoon, mingled with his scent neutralizer; evidence of a hard day's work."
"There's something special about hanging out with another musky creature. It makes you less self-conscious."
m "\"So I know you hate Payton...but don't you have to go back there for work?\""
ku "\"I'm a clerk in the town hall. So no, I'm pretty much always here.\""
m "\"Always? Do you have a car?\""
ku "\"Sold it after I came here.\""
m "\"Wow, don't you have to get out to shop for food?\""
ku "\"Sometimes. I grow what I can and the convenience store has a surprisingly good produce section, but otherwise Leo gives me rides once in a while.\""
m "\"Ah, gotcha.\""
"Again, I'm curious about what exactly happened in Payton."
"At this point I'm gonna be gone by tomorrow, and I didn't find the question to be too intrusive..."
m "\"So I don't wanna be nosey...\""
ku "\"Then maybe you shouldn't?\""
"That stops me short and I almost stop walking."
m "\"Uh...\""
"I feel my face get warm even under the heat of the sun."
"I glance over at the raccoon, but his expression isn't acusatory, angry, or even smug."
"It's just as neutral as it always is."
"It makes me wonder if this is just the raccoon's way of speaking. I already know he's blunt, after all."
"I decide to trust my impression of him."
m "\"No?\""
"I ask it with the same straight face."
ku "\"Well, you should always ask yourself if asking something nosey is a good idea.\""
ku "\"No reason to do it if it's gonna piss someone off needlessly.\""
m "\"Ah.\""
"But before I can even consider, Kudzu presses on."
ku "\"Now, considering what we were just talking about I can probably guess what you were gonna ask.\""
"I can feel the embarassment returning."
m "\"Yeah?\""
ku "\"But before I answer it, I have a question for you.\""
"I shrink a little more into myself."
m "\"Yeah?\""
ku "\"Why do you care?\""
"The question catches me by surprise and at first I wonder if this is just Kudzu's way of telling me to shut up."
"But again, after looking at his face I wonder if that's actually the case."
"I clear my throat."
m "\"Well, I like you. You're a cool guy.\""
"It comes out rather lamely, but it's the truth. He had a demeanro of not really giving a fuck about what others thought of him."
"It's like Flynn, only Kudzu didn't seem like he was putting up a front at all."
"On top of that he'd stepped in to stop a crowbar-wielding drug addict when he saw his friend in danger."
"Kudzu laughs, genuinely, and it's a bit startling."
ku "\"That's really the reason?\""
"I blush again, but for a different reason."
m "\"Well...yeah.\""
ku "\"Fair enough. And I like you too. Leo was mostly right about you.\""
m "\"Uh, what did Leo say about me?\""
ku "\"A lot of things, but you can't expect a wolf as love-smitten as he is to not exagerrate, can you?\""
m "\"Ah, no, I guess not.\""
"I step on a particularly large rock and nearly lose my balance."
"Before I can even stumble, though, Kduzu's grasping my arm tightly, stopping from from running into him."
m "\"Whoa, sorry. and thanks...\""
"This raccoon had damn fast reflexes."
ku "\"No problem.\""
"I start to walk again, but Kduzu doesn't move."
"I stop and glance at him, but he's looking up the road, not at me."
ku "\"I lost someone in Payton.\""
"It takes me a moment to realize what he's talking about, but then I do."
ku "\"By a guy with a gun who didn't give a fuck.\""
"I swallow and don't say anything, looking down at the ground."
ku "\"Happened on the same street we lived on.\""
"Of course, I have no idea what to say and wait for Kudzu to go on, but he doesn't."
"When I look up I see that he's looking right at me."
"I swallow."
m "\"Ah, yeah...that would make me want to move too.\""
ku "\"Yeah...people...and there's less of them here.\""
m "\"I'm sorry.\""
"Kudzu just looks back at me."
ku "\"Why?\""
"I open my mouth but before I can say anything Kudzu smiles."
ku "\"I'm kidding.\""
"I let my breath out in relief and laugh a little."
m "\"Well, uh, should we keep going?\""
"I start stepping the road again, but Kudzu doesn't follow."
"When I look back, he nods at the brush on the side of the road."
ku "\"It's right in here.\""

"I wasn't expecting much and I'm not disappointed as we come up on the pump."
"Mostly it's just a rusted piece of metal sticking out of the ground."
"Kudzu seems a bit put off by how lame it is himself."
ku "\"Smaller than I remember it being...\""
m "\"Meh, it's something, at least. I'll get a few shots out of it.\""
"I start unpacking the camera from the bag, a bit reluctant to do it for something so insignificant."
m "\"How'd you find this thing anyway?\""
"I look towards the road, which was basically hidden by the dense brush in front of me."
ku "\"Oh, just needing to take a piss.\""
m "\"Ah.\""
ku "\"Speaking of which...I'm gonna go do that.\""
ku "\"I can do it in front of the pump if you'd like, for effect.\""
"I force a laugh, wondering if this was the first time I'd heard the raccoon make a joke."
"At least I hope it's a joke."
"I turn the camera on and groan as I see the battery life."
ku "\"What's up?\""
"Kudzu asks from a bit deeper in the brush, facing away from me."
m "\"My battery is low. Not gonna have enough for the school. We'll have to go back and grab a spare.\""
ku "\"Oh, well, why don't you finish the footage for the pump while I run back and grab you another battery?\""
m "\"You sure?\""
ku "\"Well, yeah, it'll be faster. I've been in his house a few times. Where's it at?\""
m "\"In a dock, on his desk next to his computer.\""
ku "\"Alright. I'll be back.\""
"And with that Kudzu jogs off out of the brush and back onto the road."
"Within a minute I feel like I have all the footage I can get out of the pump."
"I sigh and rub my face, glad to at least be out of the sun, but annoyed that I'd gotten so little footage for it."
"Behind me I hear what sounds like a gag."
"I perk my ears and look back."
"I hear it again, but it's softer, more of a grunt this time."
"I'm almost positive that Kudzu didn't go that way, but I can't imagine who else it would be."
m "\"Kudzu?\""
"I wonder if maybe the heat had gotten to him. I know how dangerous heat stroke can be."
"Getting a little worried, I start moving further into the brush, my concern overpowering my fear of all the spiders that would be here."
"Again, I hear a gag and it's much louder this time."
m "\"Kud? You alright?\""
"I start pushing deeper with a bit more urgency and, not twenty yards in, I come into a clearing."
"The ground is covered in dead grass and the sun hits me again with a vengeance, feeling like I'm being physically beat into the ground again."
"I blink furiously, eyes watering under the brightness of the clearing and the blazing red behind my eyelids."
"Once they do finally adjust, though, I'm unable to fully comprehend what I see, at least not right away."
"In front of me in the meadow is a dead tree, one with dry, gnarled branches that twist up into the sky."
"The tree itself would be eerie enough, but it's what's under it that stops me dead."
"Hanging from the lowest branch is a body, long and thin, emaciated down to the skeleton."
"I remain rooted to the spot, my mouth hanging open."
"Disgustingly my mind immediately goes to the camera."
"Yeah, showing footage of a dead body to the whole class."
"Either I'd get an \"A\" for being edgy or I'd fail for showing a fucking dead body...or get expelled."
"I feel my stomach starting to turn and I'm finally able to take my first step back."
"But then it moves."
"It's a quick jerk, one of the skeleton's hands reaching up spasmodically to its neck before slumping back down."
"With my eyes fully adjusted to the sun, now, I recognize the color of the fur, the build of that skeleton-like body."
m "\"Clint!\""
"On unsteady feet I manage to stumble forward and reach out towards the ring-tail, aiming to at least hold him up until I can shout Kudzu over to help."
"Somehow, though, he's able to spin and face me, his face an expression of mortified fury."
"His eyes are almost glowing with how bloodshot they are, and his twisted muzzle is covered in drool, leaking down his chin onto his chest."
"Clint" "\"Get...back....leave!\""
m "\"What? Clint, what the hell are you doing!?\""
"I move forward again, but Clint lashes out with a foot, hitting me in the knee."
"That's when I see his toes are touching the ground, at least barely."
"I stare in confusion and look back up to meet Clint's furious eyes."
"Clint" "\"Fucking...LEAVE!\""
"Spit flies from his muzzle as I take a step back, compeltely at a loss for words."
m "\"I--I don't...\""
"His bulging eyes move from mine to look over my shoulder and he's enraged expression melts, eyes growing wider."
"Slowly, I turn around and my vision is filled with a mountain of brown fur."
"My eyes take a moment to draw out and focus and when they do, I realize that I'm actually looking at a bear."
"A huge one, even for a bear."
"Huge, naked, and carrying a long, thin branch, the bear stands in the direction I'd come from, grinning stupidly at me."
"Instinctively I widen my stance, eyes looking left and right."
"All reason has seemingly left the land of Echo and now my brain is left to try and put the pieces of the crazy place together."
"I watch as a huge tongue sticks out from between the blubbery lips to lick at them, sliding slimely between the gaps of missing teeth."
"Once he's done with that he breaks out into a grin again, those black lips shimmering under the sun, now."
"???" "\"This a friend, cat?\""
"The high-pitched voice is a bout as startling as his size."
"I look back at Flynn who's still struggling to stand on his toes, clutching at the rope, now."
"???" "\"So hard findin' a switch back there, but now it's worth it ifn' there's two of yas...\""
m "\"Uh...\""
"The squeak that comes out of my muzzle seems to perk the bear's stubby ears and he licks his lips again as he eyes me."
m "\"I, uh, I should get going. Sorry about...sorry about seeing...\""
"Words fail me as the bear takes a step forward and I start side-stepping, preparing myself to make a run for it."
"The bear mimics my stance and my stomach drops as I see him take a step forward."
#trailer?
"I change my trajectory and back away instead."
"This time he doesn't follow me, just grins as he watches me move back into the brush."
"Clint struggles on the end of his rope, twirling around lazily as he tries to get a foothold."
"I get one last look at his face as he spins around and I'm struck by the expression."
"For a moment I'm nine years old again, running through behind the buildings on Main Street, running from imaginary foreign agents."
"When I hide behind a tree next to Clint's house I hear the screen door open and, for several minutes, I watch Clint breathing deeply into a rag."
"I'm too young to understand, but for some reason I know it's not good."
"When I finally decide to run from my hiding spot, Clint looks up and we meet eyes."
"His are wide and wild, confused and hurt..."
"I stumble into the brush, finally feeling like I'm far enough away to turn and really make a run for it."
"Kudzu is standing next to the pump when I get back, holding a battery."
ku "\"Wha--\""
"I grab his arm and yank him towards the road."
m "\"Come on.\""
"I mutter it under my breath before jogging down the road, Kudzu close behind, looking over his shoulder."
"It's not until we're at the end of the road turning onto Main Street before I'm able to slow myself down and tell Kudzu what happened."
ku "\"Holy shit. That's Brian.\""
m "\"Who?\""
"I'm still panting, sweating heavily in the heat after the short jog down the street."
ku "\"Big-ass bear that lives in the brush, right? He has a trailer in there.\""
m "\"I don't know him...did he move here after I left? I thought a badger lived in that trailer?\""
ku "\"I assume so. He was here when I got here.\""
m "\"Well...what the fuck was he doing? What the hell did I just see?\""
"I still can't get over what I'd just seen."
ku "\"I don't have the answer.Can't say I'm surprised though.\""
m "\"Are you serious!? That's like the most fucked up thing I've ever seen!\""
"Kudzu smirks."
ku "\"Well, I guess I would have had to have been there, huh?\""
m "\"Yeah, I guess.\""
ku "\"But from what I know of Brian, he's dumb and violent. Pretty sure he came here because he caused too much trouble in Payton.\""
m "\"It's Clint that's the fucked up part. He's a fucking homophobe, but he's doing THAT shit?\""
ku "\"I don't know much about Clint either. What I do know is that Brian is his dealer.\""
m "\"Really?\""
"It made sense that Clint would need one in Echo, considering he was banned for life from driving after like, 3 DUIs."
m "\"But I thought Jeremy did that? Carl told me that's where he gets his weed.\""
"Kudzu shrugs again."
ku "\"I assume Clint is on more than just marijuana.\""
m "\"Huh...\""
"It's becoming clearer what kind of relationship Clint and the bear have."
"I shudder, just wishing that I hadn't had to witness it. I already felt bad for Clint, but now..."
"Kudzu holds out the battery still in his hand."
ku "\"Wanna move to the school?\""
m "\"Yeah...yeah, let's do that.\""
"The next hour is pretty uneventful, though I do get enough footage to the point where I'm satisfied."
"Not most of my work is going to have to happen the night before school."
"I swallow, stomach churning at the thought."
"On the bright side all of the stress is pushing the memory of Clint being hanged and whipped out of my mind."
"I finally get another text from Leo just before my phone dies that he's heading back, finally."
"I manage to text back that I'm hungry and that we should meet at the diner right before my screen goes black."
"He agrees to it and I invite Kudzu to come along, but he tells me that he can't stand diner food and that he was gonna go fishing anyway."
"It's too bad because I've really been enjoying the raccoon's company and fishing sounds relazing."
"I try to exchange numbers with the raccoon, but am reminded by the dead screen that i definitely can't do that."
"Kudzu takes mine though and promises to text me."
"I walk to the diner with high spirits."
"The town will be a lot less empty if I can hang around with someone like Kudzu after I move here, especially when Leo's not around."

"Leo's not in the diner when I get there."
"I pick a booth towards the back, resting my head against the patchy cushions and closing my eyes."
"The week's gone by so fast."
"It feels like only yesterday that we actually got here."
"Thinking back, I remember worrying that everything was gonna be awkward, that our past would catch up in the worst way possible."
"And it kind of did."
"We didn't fix or talk about anything."
"I feel a jolt of realization and sadness."
"This whole time I'd been preoccupied with Leo, and Leo with me."
"Wasn't Leo the one that was all concerned about us not keeping the \"pack\" together?"
"This \"send-off\" feels empty and pointless."
"It's really the last time I might get to hang out with some of them, mainly TJ and Jenna."
"And TJ had the most shit to air out...did I fuck up by sort of ignoring him this whole time?"
"I feel a lump in my throat as I think about the hike I never went on with him."
"Sure, I'd figured things out with Leo, at least temporarily."
"But now it feels like things I should have talked about with the others has been buried further."
"Even though I haven't talked to the others I can feel their resentment, knowing that Leo and I got what we wanted."
"Especially after leaving them to deal with the fallout of Flynn's meltdown."
"And now, because of that, it'll be harder to reach the root of the problem, harder to talk about."
"And because of that, we probably never will."
"I glance at my phone, noting the complete lack of texts from anyone other than Leo."
"I suppose this is life; sometimes things are buried and never talked about again."
"And in a way, I guess that's for the best."
"Sydney's death would would die with us."
"It just sucks that we all carry it, but can't rely on each other for support."
"It's at this point that I notice Janice hasn't come up to take my order."
"The diner itself is completely quiet, no old rockabilly coming over the staticy speakers."
"I look around, wondering if maybe the place was closed. I remember a few businesses didn't lock their doors."
"Mostly because of negligent employees because burglary was somewhat common here."
"I look back at the double doors to the kitchen past the counter and notice that the flourescent lights are definitely on."
"In fact it looks like I can see some movement from shadows on the wall."
"I think about getting up knocking on the doors to let them know I'm here, but that's when the front doors push open."
"Leo comes in, a big grin on this face."
l "\"{i}Chuuuuuuulaaaa!{/i}\""
"I smile as he sweeps up to my side, leaning down to smooch me on the cheek."
"He starts groping me, too, his hands sliding under my shirt."
m "\"Leo!\""
l "\"Whaaat? There's no one here.\""
m "\"Yeah, actually, I was wondering about that.\""
"I turn to look back the doors, but Leo immediately locks lips with me, forcing my head to face him again."
"I finally give in and kiss back, even giving the wolf some tongue, which he responds to enthusiastically."
"Eventually, he pulls back and takes his seat across from me, wiping his muzzle with a wink."
m "\"You're affectionate today."
l "\"Yeah, well, it' good to see you after the shit day I've had.\""
"I frown."
m "\"Yeah? What happened?\""
l "\"Dad being a dick. I told him I'd be busy this week. Made me work for a few hours.\""
m "\"Ah, well, money right?\""
l "\"Ha! They still consider my 'payment' to be the house. They only give me enough for food. no telling how long they'll hold THAT over my head.\""
m "\"That sucks.\""
l "\"Yeah...but on the bright side they'll probably lay off once you move in. It'll make me look more adult!\""
m "\"Oh is that why you're trying to get back with me?\""
"Leo smirks back at me and licks me right on the nose."
m "\"Ugh...your breath.\""
"Leo looks hurt.\""
l "\"Huh? I have bad breath?\""
m "\"Smoke! Why are you still smoking?\""
l "\"Oh...is that starting now?\""
m "\"Yes!\""
l "\"It's been a stressful day, otter. I had Duke try to start shit with me on the road.\""
m "\"Duke? About what?\""
l "\"Something about 'us'. I dunno why but he seems to think we're causing all his problems.\""
"I give Leo an incredulous look."
m "\"What.\""
l "\"Hey, I wasn't really listening. I'm was more interested in getting some food.\""
"Leo looks around."
l "\"Where is everyone?\""
m "\"That's what I was asking.\""
l "\"Janice!\""
m "\"Rude.\""
l "\"What? They should be watching for customers.\""
m "\"Doesn't mean you have to fucking scream.\""
"Leo doesn't respond, instead looking behind me, his expression one of confusion and slight shock."
"I turn in time to see Janice moving from behind the counter as the swinging door gently closes."
"Something's wrong."
"Janice had been acting strange all week, gradually looking more haggard and pissed off as time went."
"Of course, I hadn't forgotten what had happened on the side of the road a few days back."
"But I'd been content with just assuming it had been some type of drug-fueled adventure."
"Now I'm convinced she's having a mental breakdown."
"Her fur is mussed up on every inch of her body. Her eyes are wild and wide, similar to how I'd seen Clint earlier."
"Blood is smeared across her apron and the handle of a knife sticks out of the front pocket."
l "\"Janice? Are you okay?\""
"Leo's half-standing. I'm not sure if it's because he's afraid for her, or of her."
"She doesn't say anything and as she sidles up next to our booth I slide a bit towards the inside."
"Under her wild gaze I'm feeling a little trapped."
l "\"Janice?\""
"Janice" "\"Sorry about that, boys. We're a little short today.\""
l "\"Are...are you okay? Are you cooking?\""
"Leo gazes at her apron."
"Janice" "\"Yes. Yes, I'm cookin' today. What can I make you?\""
"I get the unnerving feeling that she isn't even looking at us."
l "\"Um...\""
"Leo glances back at me to which I respond with a bewildered look of my own."
l "\"You know, I think we might--\""
"Janice" "\"Nonsense, I've got everything fired up in the kitchen.\""
"Leo doesn't respond, just stares at the big coyote."
"Janice smiles crookedly."
"Janice" "\"Well, if you're not gonna order somethin' then I'll just make your favorite milkshake...\""
"With that she turns and starts waddling off."
m "\"What the fuck?\""
"I reach into my pocket, thinking about calling an ambulance for the poor woman."
"I whisper over to Leo
m "\"Should we leave?\""
l "\"Maybe\""
"Leo starts to stand up."
"The front doors open again and I look back again to see that it's Duke."
"And he's carrying a gun."
l "\"Chase...Chase, sit down.\""
"Leo stays standing, though, and Duke spots him immediately."
"Duke" "\"I told you not to fucking run away from me!\""
"He starts towards our table, but Janice, on her way towards the kitchen, intercepts him."
"Janice" "\"Duke! I am NOT going to have you barging in her to ruin the peace!\""
"She sticks her bulky body in his way."
"Duke" Get the FUCK out of my way you cunt!\""
"Janice" "\"Language!\""
"It's as as if Janice doesn't notice that there's a fucking gun being waved around."
"I reach out and grab Leo's arm, trying to pull him down."
m "\"Call the police, my phone's dead!\""
"Leo slowly sits, then looks around."
"The only exit is at the front. We're trapped."
"Duke" "\"You don't think those fuckers are behind all of this!? You've been seein' that otter around too, haven't you!?\""
"Janice" "\"I'm not concerned with that anymore. I've made things right.\""
"Duke" "\"You're not fuckin' concerned that what happened to our grandparents is happenin' to us!?\""
"Janice" "\"I won't ask you to leave again.\""
"Her voice is threatning. From this angle I can't see her hands, but I can see she's reaching for something."
m "\"Oh my God...\""
l "\"Chase, Chase, get down.\""
"Leo's voice is bizarrely calm, but as he reaches over to me I can feel him shake."
"He presses down on my shoulder and as I'm about to slide under the table I see Janice move forward, then gunshots."
"I cover my head and cower against the booth under the table."
"Leo shouts and yanks me up against his side, covering me with his arms."
"I hear him breathe heavily into my ear and I stare wideeyed from under the booth, only able to see the dirty, beige wall opposite us."
"Leo's breathing is all I can hear. Otherwise it's silent."
"Then I hear Duke muttering something under his breath, followed by soft, padding footsteps."
"A few seconds later, his legs come into view and his feet turn in to face us."
"I see the gun dangling from one hand before he raises it slightly, pointing it at us."
"I close my eyes."
"How did this happen?"
"Just seconds ago Leo and I were laughing and chatting and now I'm about to fucking die."
"I shut my eyes tightly, hugging to Leo as hard as I can and wait..."
"But nothing happens."
"I keep my face pressed into Leo's chest, though, wondering if I'm already dead."
"Finally, Duke speaks."
"Duke" "\"Leo, out. Otter, you stay there.\""
"I feel Leo hesistate against me, then his lips press against my ear."
l "\"It'll be okay, baby. Just stay here.\""
"Slowly, he untangles my arms from around him, then with his hands up, he pushes out from under the table and stands up."
"Duke" "\"Face the wall.\""
"Leo hesitates and Duke growls."
"Duke" "\"I ain't gonna fuckin' kill ya. We're just figurin' out what's happenin' is all. Killin' ya doesn't fix anythin'.\""
"Duke" "\"The last guy got killed and that didn't fix shit.\""
l "\"You shot Janice.\""
"Duke" "\"'Cuz she got in my fuckin' way! But it don't matter. Everythin's fucked up now.\""
"Leo turns to face the wall slowly."
"I watch from the space between the table and the booth
l "\"What do you want?\""
"Duke" "\"To fix this fuckin' town. You're startin' somethin' with this otter. This has all happened before.\""
"Duke looks out the window and makes a \"come on\" motion with his hand."
"Duke" "\"We're gonna stop it from happenin' this time.\""
"Leo looks to the left."
l "\"But you fucking killed Janice.\""
"I hear the wolf's voice break slightly."
"Duke" "\"Won't matter in the long run.\""
"The door's rattle as someone comes in."
"Duke" "\"You got the zip ties? Hands behind your back, Leo.\""
"Leo looks at whoever just came in."
l "\"Come on...\""
"Duke" "\"NOW!\""
"Slowly, Leo does as he's told and I see a pair of massive paws reach forward to bind the wolf's wrists."
"I swallow hard as I watch Brian pull the zip tie tight."
"Duke puts a forearm to his nose."
"Duke" "\"Fuck, you stink...I hope you didn't kill that ringtail. We could use him.\""
"Brian just grins in response, his teeth yellow."
"My stomach sinks as I think about Clint."
"Had he been warning me to run? Why had I thought that him hanging from the tree like that was probably just a normal thing for him and the bear?"
"Clint was probably just as scare as I am now."
"Duke" "\"Grab the otter and tie him up to. Just stick him in your trailer for now.\""
"My stomach drops."
"Duke gestures with his gun again."
"Duke" "\"Come on. Out.\""
"My legs are lead. I can't move."
"Leo looks over his shoulder at me and the fear in his eyes scares me even more."
"His muzzle moves, mouthing something."
"{i}Run.{/i}"
"But still, I can't move. I've never been so scared in my life. It's like everything is numb."
"Brian doesn't care, though, and moves forward, the look on his face eager."
"The gun goes off again."
"Everyone, including Brian, jumps and I cower with my hands over my head."
"Duke" "\"Fuck. FUCK!\""
"I look up and see Duke, eyes extra wild, dancing around, pointing the gun upwards, at the ceiling."
"Duke" "\"Fuck, you see that!? She's crawlin' around up there. I told ya she's on my ceilin' every night watchin' me!\""
"Brian's looking up too and for the first time his face is twisted into an expression that isn't stupidly grinning."
"It's full of fear."
"I look up, too, but nothing's there."
l "\"Chase!\""
"Leo hisses at me and that jolts me back to reality."
"Without even willing myself to do it I shoot out from under the table."
"In front of me are two exits; the front doors and the kitchen door, which is closer."
"There has to be an exit in the kitchen, but I'm not sure of that."
"My legs are already making me run, though, and I have to choose now."
menu:
    "The kitchen door.":
        "I have no idea how long Duke will be distracted, so I dive behind the counter for my closest exit."
        l "\"Don't look back, Chase! Go as fast as you can!\""
        "Duke" "\"Shit! He's getting away, Brian!\""
        "I push past the swinging door and..."
        "...immediately slip."
        "One moment I'm standing and the next I'm laying on the tile, face stinging from the smack into the tile."
        "I stare blearily at the ground, forcing myself to move again, but it's still so slippery."
        "At first I think the tiles are just red, but when the overpowering metallic scent hits my nose I realize it's more than that."
        "Blood is everywhere, and now I'm covered in it."
        "I sob, wondering when the nightmare I'm in is gonna end, when the paralysis will hit me."
        "Duke" "\"Fuck! FUCK! Get her off me!!!\""
        "I force myself to move, though, because I need to get the fuck out of here, dream or not."
        "I slip and slide along the tile, trying to stand, almost failing."
        "I manage to grab the metal counter, though, and yank myself up."
        "And then I'm standing over the counter, and over what's on top of it."
        "The body is unrecognizable."
        "I can see black and white fur, but it's a pile of unrecognizable parts."
        "Butchered."
        "Something cooks on the stove."
        "My stomach churns and I heave, but there's nothing in me to come up."
        "A bang behind me forces me to turn around and as I turn to my right I see the mountainous form of brian charge through the door."
        "He slips immediately, but his momentum still takes him forward and he reaches out of me."
        "Next thing I know is that a car has hit me and I'm flying back."
        "My fall comes up short as I hit something, the wall behind me, and my head explodes."

    "The front doors.":
        "I have no idea if that kitchen has an exit and there's no way I can risk it."
        l "\"Don't look back, Chase! Go as fast as you can!\""
        "As I charge down the aisle I almost trip over the large form of Janice."
        "She's laying on her stomach, hands outstretched."
        "A smear of red leads to the knife a few feet in front of her."
        "I don't have time to dwell on it as I leap over her body, then charge through the doors."
        "The bright sun and heat contrasts heavily with the cool dimness of the diner, but I don't have time to wait for my eyes to adjust."
        "I take off down the road and a few seconds later I hear the doors smash as something larger and heavy comes right after me."
        "I don't look back."
        "I gasp and wheeze as I run up the road and turn onto Leo's street."
        "No one's around. And aside from the dull thumping some distance behind me, it's completely silent. Something terrible has happened."
        "And not just in the diner. The entire town."
        "I'm not sure why I decided to run for Leo's house, but my mind is numb and reasoning is hard."
        "Briefly I think about Kudzu, but as I run past his yard I don't see any sign of him and I don't have time to try his door."
        "I slam into Leo's door, pushing it open as I do."
        "I slam it back shut and lock it with the deadbolt, then take off down the hall for Leo's room."
        "I hear the door knob turning back and forth as something heavy slams into it."
        "I don't even know if Leo has a landline and I look left and right wildly, not spotting a single thing that might be a telephone."
        "I reach Leo's room and shut the door, wishing it had a lock."
        "Jukmping to the outlet with my wallcharger, I clumsily take my phone out of my pocket."
        "It takes three tries to succesfully jam the connector into my phone."
        "Bouncing with terror, I watch as the screen lights up, giving me the battery charging symbol."
        "Not enough power for it to power on yet."

        "A window breaks just down the hall and I almost piss myself."
        "More shattering glass followed by silence...."
        "I don't dare to even breathe."
        "And then heavy footsteps pacing around and the massive bear charges around the house, looking for me."
        "I get down on my knees, for some reason, and try to squeeze up under the desk all my stuff is on."
        "I look at my phone again, but it's still at 0%."
        "I'm out of time."
        "The door swings open with a crash and the bear spots me instantly."
        "He rushes at me and I let out an involuntary scream."
        "I dive out from under the desk as soon as he's on top of me and try to roll away."
        "He's big, but slow as hell and I manage to get to my feet."
        "At that moment he lunges at me and swings a huge fist at my face."
        "I jerk back, but he still clips my chin, sending me into a spin and my world into blackness."
        "I stare at the floor, mind wandering in circles."
        "There's heavy breathing above me and, as I get to my hands and knees something impacts my side so hard it sends me rolling into the wall."
        "I stare at the ceiling, lungs broken as I writhe around for air."
        "The bear obscures my vision, then reaches down to grab me by the shirt and yank me up."
        "He stares at me and I stare back before he swings me into the wall again and my vision goes dim."
        "He does it again, then again. On the fifth swing the dimming finally turns to black."
