"My parents had caught me watching gay porn that morning on the computer, and I was afraid to come home to them, so I went to some party at Parsons."
"The night itself is kind of a blur."
"I remember getting in a very brief fight with a guy who dumped beer on TJ, and then waking up with Leo over me - eyes full of concern."
"Somehow, I ended up confiding everything to him about me being into guys."
"He apparently had a hunch about it, and next thing I knew, he was ushering me out of the old warehouse to walk home with him."
"We kissed in the railyard by his house.. and that was about the start of our relationship proper."
"Still, something always seemed a bit off about that party, and the way Leo was acting."
"I think I remember.. some dude trying to come up to talk to him, and Leo telling him off before insisting that I not ask about it."
"He seemed really serious at the time."
"'Didn't want to ruin a good thing' or something like that."
"I didn't get a good look at the guy he talked to, but he was carrying.. a camera?"

"Despite everything that's happened.."
"..Brian's attack, the hallucinations, the kidnapping, the haunted van, the voice in my head, Heather's house, and the town going nuts.."
"..everyone is silent as our headlights shine down the long stretch of Route 65 ahead."
"Maybe we're just exhausted."
"Physically, emotionally.. spiritually?"
"I exhale and rest my forehead against the cool window, watching the town's lights blur past."
"Soon, the lights stop and are replaced by darkness - shadows of shapes barely visible through the condensation-tinged glass."
"We never go this way. No one does."
"We're getting close to Echo Canyon."
"The bumps and hills of Echo being replaced by vast open desert, contrasted by the sheer cliff face of the western mesa."
"There's not much out here but land owned by the feds - most notably the dam and the old proving grounds."
"I remember there used to be a checkpoint booth up ahead, but it hasn't been manned in decades."
"It's here you can see the lake most clearly. All of it."
"It seems.. smaller than I remember."
"Yet, there's still that tightness in my gut, and the urge to look away."
"So I do."
"I keep my eyes fixed on the space between my feet, Flynn's camouflage patterned floor mat oddly captivating."
"It's then I notice a blinking green light shining through my left pocket."
"Instinctively I think it's my phone and reach for it, but then I remember as I pull it out."
"It's the pink, walkie-talkie, baby-monitor thing from earlier."
"I run my thumb over the surface of it, feeling the worn, chipped plastic."
"It looks like there might even be little teeth marks on the side, like a small child gnawed on it at some point."
"I remember being like that: thinking everything colorful must be some edible dessert, waiting to be bitten into."
"I press my thumb against what I think is the talk button, but any labels on this have long worn off."
"Bringing the device up a little, I open my mouth as if to speak, but stop short of actually saying anything."
"I realize I don't want to freak the others out right now."
"Seeing the lake again, I look back down."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}Hello, good sir."
"I freeze."
m "\"H-.. hello?\""
"Flynn looks over at me."
f "\"Hm?\""
"Jenna stares ahead."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}Hello, good sir."
"That same voice, crackling and old, spoken in the same cadence as before."
"I glance over, and Flynn's gone back to focusing on driving, with Jenna still looking at the road blankly."
"No one's reacting to this thing going off."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}Hello, good sir."
"Is there a voice really coming from this old toy?"
"I stare at the flashing green light and am reminded of the van from earlier."
"That voice felt much more.. vivid - alive."
"Real sound."
"This one is like.. I'm remembering a sound, but I've never heard this voice before."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}-and how are you?"
"Huh?"
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}-and how are you?"
"It repeats."
"It's distorted, but it sounds like a woman's voice."
#
"I've been better, that's for sure."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}Sorry to hear that."
"Oh."
"I guess it can read my thoughts?"
"That's comforting."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}Things will get better soon."
"I start to consider sliding the walkie back into my pocket."
"Nothing this thing is saying can be doing me any good right now."
"Especially noting that I'm the only one hearing it."
"Just.. more hallucinations."
"Crazy swamp gas, tulpa bullshit..."
"..."
"It doesn't seem to be saying anything now."
"The minutes pass and I begin to relax some."
"I look past the device in my paw, the night sky reflected upon the surface of the lake - a streak of white light where the moon is."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}-not your fault."
"The voice comes through a little clearer."
"What do you mean?"
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}-not your fault."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}-intentions... pure."
"The words start coming out even choppier, as if hastily clipped from an audio file."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}It was a loving act, and one cannot fault themselves for a loving act."
"What are you talking about?"
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}I wish we could talk-..."
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}-more, but you have places to be!"
"{cps=22}{font=ui/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}-places to be!"
"The road begins taking us into the canyon proper, and the light on the walkie flicks off."

"He blinks, shocked - the bat's hands beginning to shake as he checks his torso."
"He whirls around, spotting a light spray of blood around the bullet hole in the wall."
"That's when the pain hits him, and he slowly begins to raise his wing."
"Clipped right through the center is a bloody hole, the edges of the impact site looking like frayed fabric."
"The bat slumps back, exuding ragged gasp."

"Leo's eyes bulge, and he starts to move, but stops when that revolver is swiveled toward him."
m "\"Heather!\""
"I shout, trying to draw attention away from the others."
"Though, I quickly realize I have no clue what to say."
m "\"We're, uh.. we're just here looking for Carl. Remember, like we mentioned during the bonfire?\""
"My voice is shaky, cracking as I speak."
"The cat's chest rises and falls, like she's hyperventilating. It's been that way since she stepped out of the closet."
"She makes her way over toward the slumped form of Carl, still half-covered in his blanket."
"Then she points the gun down at him."
h "\"I'm going to shoot him in his stupid, FAT, UGLY FACE unless you leave right now!!\""
"She's absolutely screaming, her demands spouted with such a pitch, her voice constantly cracks."
"Tears begin to roll down her already wet cheeks, her eyes puffy."
"Beneath her, Carl covers his face with the blanket, visibly trembling from a mixture of fear and exhaustion."
m "\"Okay! Right on!\""
"I swallow."
m "\"That's.. that's the plan? Right guys?\""
m "\"We're just gonna leave, nice and slow?\""

mi "\"Are you fuckin' kiddin' me!?\""
"Micha's outburst is directed toward me."
mi "\"No, not after we came all this way. We're not leavin' the rich boy.\""
"He practically hisses his words."
"He's cupping a hand over his wound and trying to avoid stretching the skin of his wing, as that seems to just make the hole bigger."
mi "\"Heather, you have no reason to be keepin' that chunky bitch here!\""
mi "\"Just let us take his ass and leave.\""

h "\"THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING THOUGH!\""
h "\"You just.. g-give it a silly name, but it's not silly! IT'S HORRIBLE AND I HATE IT!\""
"Micha opens his mouth to snap back, but Heather shrieks, a blubbering of spit coming from her mouth, snot running down her nose."
"She begins to press her finger closer to the trigger."
l "\"Carl, move!\""
"She doesn't fully finish pulling the trigger, leaving us all staring wide-eyed in suspense."
"She looks like she's dry heaving, trying to throw up an immensely sick feeling within her that will not leave."
h "\"I CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING ANYMORE! THE RINGING IS SO LOUD!\""
h "\"IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE HIM! HE WON'T STOP!\""
"Heather flails in the direction of the shadowy figure in the closet."
"Even though the man in the closet is very much dead, he's propped up in a way that makes it look like he's watching Heather pace around the room."
"His dark sockets following her while her back is turned."
"She seems afraid to look at him."
"The feline closes her eyes for a moment."
"I can tell Leo is weighing his chances of whether he can tackle her to the ground before she can get a shot off."
"Before he can move, they open again, and she speaks - her voice still shrill, but quieter."
h "\"Everyone thinks I'm stupid, that I'll never do anything but rot away like everyone else..\""

h "\"This town is evil!\""
h "\"A-and I'm gonna stop it!\""
h "\"I'm gonna do something with my life for once - and not be some plaything.\""
"She growls at the ground as she says this."
h "\"It's what Keith told me all the time before h-he.. went away for a while.\""
"Heather stands there, shaking in place as if trying to muster the courage to do something."
"She begins to strafe, getting closer to the closet and bending down to pick up something beside the corpse."
"It's a bloody folder, with a little booklet stapled to the front."
"I recognize the emblem on the cover: The Reclamation Bureau."
"Heather's paw covers the front, but I can still make out, \"-aughter's Dam Basic Operation and Procedures Manual\"."
"Outside, there's some movement by Duke's truck."
"Trying to not draw attention to myself, I glance out the window and spot the familiar pattern of orange and black scales and TJ's tufty fur."
"There's a glint of something metallic: Flynn's repeater, which is currently sighted toward the hysterical cat."
"Heather is so close to us now."
"Flynn wouldn't risk trying to take the shot, right?"
"The idea of Flynn shooting anyone is just unfathomable in its own right."
"Jenna's out there with them too."
"She's speaking to Flynn, pointing."
"The lizard is shaking, saying something back."
"This back and forth continues."
mi "\"What are you even talking about?\""
h "\"I'm gonna ma-.. I'm gonna make it so there is no town.\""
"As Heather turns away, she catches a glimpse of the blood on the folder, then looks back toward the closet."
"She screams, but she's not staring at the corpse."
"It's like she's looking above it, at something else at eye-level."
