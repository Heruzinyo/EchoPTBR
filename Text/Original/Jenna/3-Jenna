"I look towards Leo, hunched forward, ears down, looking like an angry gargoyle perched on the ledge of a church."
m "\"Hold on, Jenna.\""
"I turn back around to face her."

j "\"Hmm?\""
"I look back over my shoulder at Leo, watching his ears flick towards us."
m "\"I think...I think Leo wants to be left alone.\""
"Jenna folds her arms and looks past me."
J "\"You sure? He always likes talking to you.\""
"I look at Jenna for a while, realizing how much I'd rather be talking to a collected person, rather than a big angry wolf."
m "\"Yeah, I'm sure.\""
j "\"Well, alright. Should we head back, then?\""
m "\"Sure.\""
"As we start disappearing into the sage brush, I look back in time to catch a glimpse of Leo before he disappears behind the brush."
"He's staring straight back at me, now, eyes sharp, ears forward."
"I look back down at the ground, wondering if it would have been a good idea to at least tell him that I felt like he needed time alone."
"Jenna starts walking back anyway and I hurry to catch up with her."
m "\"Where you going?\""
j "\"To find TJ.\""
"I also kinda feel like TJ needs his time alone, but Jenna always worried about him."
"I follow her through the brush in silence, unsure of what to say."
j "\"Why aren't you hanging out with Leo?\""
"I move along with her for a while, thikning it over."
m "\"I dunno. When he's in a bad mood he's really only good for a fight, you know?\""
j "\"Hmm.\""
"I catch up and start walking alongside her, the heat really starting to get to me."
m "\"Yeah, thought it would be a good idea to let him cool down for a bit.\""
"I sort of envy the way she's dressed right now, with her short shorts and tank top. I'm really regretting the way my jeans go all the way down to my ankles right now."
"I finally start to see our picnic again. Carl's still sitting in the lawn chair, his head hanging over the back and smoke wafting around him."
"Jenna stops and puts her paws on her hips, looking around with her big ears up."
m "\"Where do you think he went?\""
j "\"Aren't many places he could have gone.\""
"Her eyes seem to settle and I follow her gaze to a clump of brush and trees next to the river."
"It's clear that if TJ could have gone anywhere and disappeared in the short amount of time he had, that would be the place."
"Without a word, Jenna starts in that direction. I tag along awkwardly, kind of feeling like I was invisible to her right now."
"As soon as we breath through the brush, we spot TJ."
