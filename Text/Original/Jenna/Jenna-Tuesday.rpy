"That makes me bristle, because there definitely are snakes here. I can't help but scan the brush."
t "\"You really shouldn't worry about that. They're more afraid of you than you are of them AND they do have a rattle, so just listen for it.\""
"Jenna grins and looks straight at me."

j "\"The water thing is actually more of a psychological need as opposed to a physical one.\""
m "\"Oh yeah?\""
"I look over my wet camera bag, which definitely didn't need water."
j "\"Yeah, you know, back when there weren't really any ethics in research they separated an otter pup from water, never allowed to swim.\""
"That makes me pause. Technically, in this day and age, otters don't really need to swim. A trip to the supermarket gets all that done."
"But something about not being allowed to be in water, to feel the cool, isolated space that I so longed to be in..."
m "\"What happened?\""
j "\"Depressed, disengaged, neurotic in general. Then, when they were done, they just set him loose into the world. He killed himself a few years later.\""
m "\"Wow...\""
j "\"Yup. I mean, ethics are in place now, of course, not that the Psychological Association is any better.\""
j "\"You probably heard about their role in the whole advanced interrogations controversy.\""
m "\"Like the waterboarding stuff?\""
j "\"Yeah. But it really makes you realize how powerful the brain is. It's not all physical necessities.\""
m "\"Must have been pretty awful for him that he killed himself. I can't imagine.\""
"Talking about offing oneself, though, it's got me thinking about Jenna's brother."

m "\"No!\""
"Well, I sort of did, but I don't think that would be appropriate at all."
m "\"I was just wondering...are you gonna go see your family sometime during the trip? We talked about it earlier, but I guess you didn't really give an answer.\""
"Jenna snorts loudly, tossing her head back."
j "\"You're kidding, right?\""
"I feel my cheeks flush, knowing that I might have said something really offensive. I'm not really in tune with how things are with Jenna's family."
"Leo, and sometimes even Flynn, dealt with most of that."
m "\"I mean, aren't you a little bit curious?\""
j "\"Curious is the wrong word.\""
m "\"Oh?\""
j "\"Maybe morbidly curious. Anyway, they haven't bothered contacting me since I left so, as far as I can tell, they're not missing me.\""
t "\"Guys, there's a giant dip over here, so watch your step!\""
"TJ's quite a bit ahead of us now. I don't even see him anymore around all the boulders and brush."

m "\"Well...do YOU miss them?\""
"She doesn't say anything for awhile, which tells me she's really thinking about it."

j "\"Jeremy, though...I guess I wouldn't mind seeing him again.\""

"Jeremy was, for as along as I can remember, a royal dick. A bully to me, TJ, and Carl."
"Along with Clint, he terrorized our childhood."
"That is, until Leo showed up."
"I'll never forget the day Leo rammed Jeremy's head into a tree, and punched Clint so many times in the face his eyes almost swelled shut."
"Of course, Leo never got in trouble because neither of their parents gave a shit."
j "\"Environment is really important to how you develop as a person.\""
"I think for a second."
m "\"Well, you turned out alright.\""
j "\"Environment AND temperament make us who we are. Some people...some people can just take more.\""
"It's clear that her \"temperament\" was a lot stronger than mine, whatever that was. If I had parents like that...I don't know how I would have survived."

"Fur prickles on the back of my neck."
"I'm not sure what it is, but something isn't right. I look left and right in the small chance that someone else is coming up the trail."

"{i}Something's watching you from the brush...{/i}"
"A shiver runs right up my spine and I tremble under its influence."
"As if of its own accord my head whips around, immediately focusing in on a clump of sage brush thirty feet away."
"And there, right in the middle, someone's face is staring at me."
"I can only call it a face because there are two eyes, and a mouth, but I've never seen anything like it."
"It's flat, wide, and stretched out; sagging where the chin should be."
"I can't help myself."
"I yelp loudly and stumble to the side as I whip my body around to defend myself, somehow conscious of the fact that my dick is still out."
"Then, it all comes together. I stare for a few seconds longer, then force out a tight, high-pitched laugh."
m "\"Are you fucking kidding me?\""
"It's a rock, a white rock, and the sage brush twigs have fallen over it perfectly to give it features similar to that of a face."
"I sigh and rub my own face with both my paws, feeling my heart hammering in my chest."
"I always did this shit to myself."
"As I lower my paws I notice a wet streak across the left side of my pants. I hadn't finished peeing, yet."
m "\"Fucking son of a bitch.\""

"The rock isn't there anymore."
"I stare, one paw on the boulder, feeling my fur starting to bristle out all over my body."
m "\"What...?\""
"Maybe it's because I'm at a different angle now..."
"The feeling of being watched is overpowering, though, and it's coming from the other side of the boulder, where I was just at."
"I look up the trail, but I don't see TJ or Jenna at all."
"I can't even hear them. I look back towards the boulder, wondering if I'm losing my mind."
"Gritting my teeth, I turn away and start back up the trail at a brisk walk, knowing that I'm acting just like a little kid."
"Despite that, I feel myself start to panic a little and soon enough I'm running up the trail, and I'm not looking back."
