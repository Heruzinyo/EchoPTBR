c "\"Guys, I just--I don't know about this.\""
"I peek into the bathroom, watching as Carl stares at himself in the mirror, running his fingers through his hair."
ra "\"You look great!\""
"Raven stands grinning with a trimmer in his paws, looking Carl up and down."
ra "\"Tell him, Chase!\""
"Carl looks at me and, while he looks different, he's a lot more handsome."
m "\"You look fantastic. A lot cleaner!\""
c "\"Thanks?\""
ra "\"We're going for a rocker-musician look, right? But at the same time we wanna say 'hey, I know my music, I like to live on the wild side of things...but I'm also super duper responsible!\""
"Carl looks skeptically at Raven."
c "\"Are you kidding me?\""
ra "\"Nope! Now take a shower then get into your new clothes!\""
"Before Carl can say anything Raven shoves the mall bag into Carl's chest before slamming the door in his face."
ra "\"Man, this is going to be great. If the interview was based on looks alone he'd get have that job locked!\""
m "\"Yeah, probably.\""
"I had to admit; Carl was looking good with his new haircut. I can only hope that the clothes match it."
#transition
"After half an hour, at which point I'm starting to worry about time, Carl walks into the living room, shuffling in slowly on his hooves."
"We don't even know he's there until he clears his throat."
#Carl reveal.
c "\"Uh...so, uh...how does it look?\""
"His new look aside, I've never seen Carl so uncomfortable looking."
"His shifts from hoof to hoof, not making eye contact at all, his fingers pulling at the hem of his shirt."
ra "\"Oh my God. That looks fantastic! There's NO WAY you won't get that job now!\""
"Raven sounds genuine enough, but then again he's always excited."
"Carl looks over at me and I start as I realize my silence must have seemed bad."
m "\"You do look great, Carl!\""
"Carl sighs and shifts around again."
"We watch him expectantly."
c "\"Dudes, this just...this feels weird, is all.\""
ra "\"It's new. You'll get used to it!\""
ra "\"If everything goes well today we can shop for more stuff in the same vein.\""
"Carl frowns but I don't have time to dwell on it because it's at that point that I look at the time."
m "\"Alright, we really need to head out. We should get there early.\""
"Raven makes as if to follow us, but that's when I remember that we're going to be at the lake right after the interview."
"I turn to him as Carl heads out the door."
m "\"Hey, Raven?\""
"He stops."
ra "\"What's up?\""
m "\"So after the interview me and Carl...and our other friends. We're gonna be doing something.\""
"Raven looks a little confused, and I see him blushing a bit on the insides of his ears."
m "\"Oh, it's not that we don't want you to come!\""
"Actually, his upbeat attitude might be welcoming considering the solemn mood that's bound to prevail."
m "\"It's just that...it's really personal.\""
ra "\"Oh really?\""
m "\"Yeah. Honestly, you wouldn't wanna come. we're gonna be talking about some heavy shit.\""
"Raven seems to perk up a little at that."
ra "\"Oh! Well, I wouldn't want to intrude. I'll just hang out here, then.\""
m "\"Yeah, we'll be back soon, okay?\""
ra "\"Sounds good! But you HAVE to tell me how the interview goes. I know he's going to do amazing!\""
m "\"I will and he will. See you in a few.\""
#transition to road
"Carl looks confused as I come out to the car alone and start to pull out of the driveway."
c "\"Where's Raven?\""
m "\"Uhh, so, I wanted to tell you this after the interview so you didn't have more to stress out over.\""
c "\"What?\""
"I pause as I back out, pretending to be distracted so I can gather my thoughts."
m "\"So...Leo wants us to meet up at the lake.\""
c "\"The lake. THE lake?\""
m "\"Yeah...\""
c "\"Why?\""
m "\"Closure, he says.\""
"Carl stays quiet as we drive through Echo and I swerve to avoid all of the potholes."
"As I'm merging onto the highway he finally speaks up."
c "\"I think it's a good idea. Like, we've been sitting on this for how long? We should do it while we have the chance.\""
"I nod my agreement."
m "\"I just hope everyone else feels the same.\""
"We fall back into silence, and it stays that way for the remaining twenty minute drive."
"Carl gets more nervous the closer we get."
"I can see his knees bouncing out of the corner of my eye, along with all of his other fidgeting."
"I reach out and put a paw on his shoulder as we pull into the parking lot."
m "\"You look awesome, and you're gonna do amazing.\""
c "\"I'm gonna take this out.\""
"Carl reaches up for his nose ring."
m "\"Hey, HEY!\""
"He stops when I raise my voice."
m "\"You and I both know what this store is like; chill, relaxed, and quirky...you're all of those things!\""
"Carl starts taking deep breaths, staring out the windshield."
m "\"Just be yourself. And you know how indie record stores are...they love this grungey, non-comformist look!\""
"I tug at his tanktop."
"Carl just nods, but he doesn't look at me."
m "\"Do you want me to go in with you?\""
"Carl shakes his head quickly, unbuckling his seatbelt as he opens the car door."
c "\"No man, I'll--I'll be fine. I'll be right back.\""
m "\"Okay, cool. I'll be waiting!\""
"I grin at him, but he just shuts the door and ambles up to the doors."
"He pushes on them and, when they don't move, he pushes harder, shaking the glass."
"I start to open my door to tell him to pull instead, but he seems to figure it out before I have to and disappears inside."
"I frown, and quietly pray for him."
"Then, I sit back and wait."
