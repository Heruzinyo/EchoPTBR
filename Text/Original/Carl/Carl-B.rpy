"The sloshing sounds get a bit louder as James steps in front of the floodlight."
"Then he tips the container he's holdings upside down, and I see a long nozzle, light shining through the translucent neck."
"I realize what it is as I hear liquid pattering onto the pile James has made."
"The smell of gasoline hits my nose as I start to panic."
m "\"Carl? Carl, wait, stop!\""
"My other hand pops free as I start to writhe around, but it's my legs that I need to get me out of here."
m "\"Carl? James, please, don't do this, can you let me go first?\""
"James moves away from the pile to pour the gas on the other bins."
m "\"Why are you doing this to me!?\""
"He flashes me a grin before continuing to splash gas onto all the bins, walking in a circle around me."

"Once Carl completes the circle of bins, he disappears behind the floodlight again."
"At that point, I start to pull at the bindings wildly, tugging at my ankles, internally screaming at every tug on my injury."
"This time the foxes don't approach, they just watch from the darkness."
m "\"Help...me...\""
"I sob through clenched teeth at them, but they don't move."
"I stop struggling, instead trying to feel through the bindings, tugging here and there, trying to loosen something."
"Finally I start to feel the knots shift a bit."
"My right leg comes free."
"The whispers crescendo, along with some giggling sounds."
"I hear James coming back and I try to keep twisted up in my feigned hogtie position."
"A glow appears in the darkness, and I see James step in front of the floodlight with a lighter in his hand."

"A small figure runs from behind the light and with a loud smack, the lighter goes flying."
"It's flung in my direction and, thankfully, it goes out as it flies through the air, then skitters on the dirt toward me."
"I drop the facade and uncurl, snatching the lighter up and struggling to stand."
"I'm just in time to see a huge ram charging me, his horns down, aimed straight at my chest."
"I jump to the side, but get clipped in the elbow, sending me and the lighter spinning through the air."
"James doesn't even go for me, instead disappearing into the dark after the lighter."
"I don't wait to see how it turns out, rushing toward the exit to the mine."
"I'm just a few feet away from the exit when I hear a huge whooshing sound and wind seems to rush from the exit, almost blowing me back."

"Breath is sucked from my lungs, and I go down to my knees, covering my head as it feels like all my fur is going to be burned off."
"I look behind me at the blinding fire."
m "\"Carl!\""
"I cover my mouth and nose, trying to breathe, but the heat beats me back like a physical force."
"And now, everything is real."
"I'm in the crawlspace, the massive beams are gone, the ceiling is lower, there's no more mine."
"I back up into the doorway, getting blasted with smoke."
m "\"CARL!\""
"I scream as loud as I can, all the while I'm still moving back."
"And then I see the familiar horns and Carl appears from the smoke and flames, singed, but alive."
"He charges at me, and I see the rage in his eyes."
"I might be back in the mansion, but Carl isn't..."
"I back away into the basement, out of the crawlspace, ducking low as smoke billows over me."
"It looks like Carl's coming after me, but just as he reaches out..."
"Little tiny paws grasp around his waist, his chest, and his face, pulling him back into the crawlspace."
"Carl reaches out, latching onto the door frame, snarling with rage."
"His eyes are wide, spittle flying from his mouth as he fights to pull himself from the grasp of the small foxes."
"I watch and only hesitate for a moment before I reach out to grasp one of Carl's hands."
"He may be possessed, he may have tried to kill me, but my friend is still in there somewhere"
"—And there's no way in hell I'll willingly let him burn to death."
"I lean back, pulling the ram as hard as I can, getting a face full of smoke as I stand to get some leverage."
"Carl, or James, grunts and growls, as if unsure of what to do."
"The little hands hold firm though, pulling back into the flaming pit behind the ram."
"I get weak, my lungs screaming in the smokey air, feeling my limbs start to give out—"
"And then something gives, but it's Carl."
"The hands pull through him, and something large and transparent gets pulled out."
"It flies back with a howl, and Carl flies forward into me, the door goes closed with a snap."

"The following events are a blur to me."
"I remember seeing Carl staring down at me, yelling my name."
"I remember a blind stumble through smoke."
"A dark basement, crumbling stairs, and two sets of bloody footprints through the kitchen and out into the night."
"We follow them."
"And then sitting in the desert, my head in Carl's lap."
"I watch his eyes glitter in the dancing firelight."
"His eyes are blank and far away."
"I reach up to touch his face, say thanks somehow."
"He doesn't look down."
"His eyes stay empty..."
