"Julian had driven down over an hour ago to pick us up before driving to Carl's house."
"Carl wasn't ready when we got there and when he answered the door, his eyes were bleary and red."
"It took him a good twenty minutes to get ready, and all the while I struggle not to glare at him."
"It's weird, I've been friends with the ram for almost my entire life and it's only now that I'm feeling real disgust for the person that he is."
"So many self-created problems."
"He keeps his head down most of the time, so he doesn't see me."
"He's still feeling sick too, so he opts to ride in the truck bed on the way down and Jenna sits with him."
"I can't help but wonder what might happen if we have an accident."
"TJ sits next to me and this time I'm sure to sit in the middle so that Julian is on my left and TJ is on my right."
"It feels better this way."
"As the lake comes into view, I rest a paw on TJ's knee."
"He glances at me, then nods in acknowledgment."
"I give his thigh a squeeze, then wait as we pull into the parking lot, going over the scenarios in my head for what might happen."
ju "\"Well, here we are.\""
"We don't say anything in response as we quietly get out of the truck."
"Jenna jumps out of the truck bed easily, but Carl struggles and I imagine him falling straight out and face planting into the asphalt."
