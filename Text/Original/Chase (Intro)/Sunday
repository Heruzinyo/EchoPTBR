m "\"The town grew quickly in size and, once it began to serve as a junction along Prescott Railway, it reached a peak population of 6500 in 1877.\""
m "\"It was at this point in time that a peculiar phenomenon of mass hysteria took over. Many say the reason this occurred was due to the discovery of a body within the gold mine and the circumstances surrounding that discovery.\""

m "\"However, the town still managed to prosper well enough until 1942. That's when the government stepped in to shut down the mine as it became a federal law to divert all mining resources to the war effort.\""
m "\"The town's population sharply declined shortly thereafter and, by the 1950s, it had dwindled to approximately 2,000 people.\""
m "\"A shutdown of the Prescott railway in the 1960s, followed by the bypassing of route 93 by I-40 in 1986 was the final nail in the coffin for the town.\""

"I think for a minute."
"The weird, crawling thing, the screaming thing...I pull my head up, looking towards the stage, which is empty right now."
m "\"It...it doesn't matter, it was just a dream.  Hey, what happened to the show?\""
"Carl chuckles next to me, leaning back again."
c "\"Ya missed 'em, dude.  We've seen like, three shows.\""
t "\"Yeah, they even had a segment with otters doing water tricks! We thought about waking you up for it, but you were in a really deep sleep.\""
"That's too bad, I always loved seeing my people laughed at for the swimming clowns that we are."
m "\"How long's it been?\""
"Carl checks his phone, which he already has out."
c "\"Been about three hours, could probably get some lunch now.\""
"Damn, I'd been out for a while.  I'm surprised I hadn't at least woken up a few times, considering the uncomfortable position I'd been in."
t "\"I guess you feel better, then?\""
c "\"Yeah, been feelin' better for the past two hours. Now I'm hungry.\""
"I've composed myself for the most part and take out my phone to text Leo. It's already 2 PM, so I tell him we're hungry, and that we should meet up."
"He gets back to me pretty quick, saying that they are mostly done with the big rides, and that we should meet at the center of the park in the food court."
