"Yeeyah River feeds Emma Lake from the North."
"It's a farther drive than the lake itself, but it does have a few nice clearings along its edge."
"One of them has a few benches and a rusted-to-hell public grill that I'm sure no one has used in decades."
"This is the place that we go."
"As we're unloading Leo's van, I decide to get the b-roll of the lake right away."
"It won't have much of a presence in the packet, so I think I'm just gonna narrate over it later."
"The actual lake is only a few minutes walk from here."
"It's a bit difficult navigating around the sage brush, and I know I'm gonna have to check for ticks later."

"I'm getting uncomfortable with the idea of me holding this camera while I navigate this terrain."
"It probably would have been better if Leo had just parked the car next to the reservoir while I got out to film, but I guess even that still wasn't okay."
"There's a large square of paved ground next to the parking lot, now, several benches, and a row of brand new grills."
"Several lamps have been erected around the area, too."
"Leo was right about the town trying to turn the reservoir into a recreational spot."
"I can actually see a few jet boats skimming through the water, leaving long trails of white behind them."
"There's even what looks like a feline of some sort fishing in the shallows."
"It would explain why the motel is still in business."
"Lake Emma is fairly small, only about twelve miles long and five wide."
"I look around before climbing to the top of a nearby hill and get my shots."
"Even with a few people there, it's still pretty quiet, aside from the train horns, and it's kind of eerie."
"I wrap up and start to quickly make my way back."
"It's hard to explain why I'm getting freaked out in broad daylight with people around."
"Either it's because of what happened all those years ago, or I'm just psyching myself out."

"It sounds a lot more serious than our usual squabbles, so I quicken my pace."
"They seem to quiet down a bit once they see me coming."
"TJ's off to the side, looking out over the river, occasionally throwing a rock into it."
"Carl sits in a lawn chair, one of six that have been set out in a semi-circle."
"He has his chin on a fist as he lazily stares at me."
"Jenna and Leo both stand next to each other, looking at Flynn who's got his back turned, rummaging through the cooler."

"The silence is still awkward, and I have no idea what the hell to do with myself."
"I finally realize that I'm still holding the camera and decide to put that away."
m "\"Hey, uh, I'm gonna go for a quick swim. Haven't been in water in a while.\""
"When we first got here I was completely disappointed to find that the motel didn't have its own swimming pool."
"Being an otter, I usually like to swim at LEAST once a day, if not more."
"It's been three days, and I'm feeling antsy as hell for it.."
"Flynn finally turns around, a beer in his hand as he cracks it open."
"It was true that he'd been acting a bit strange today."
"He'd held the entire trip up by a few hours, and when he'd finally shown up his eyes were bleary, and he seemed sluggish, like he'd been up all night."
"When we'd asked if he was alright, he brushed us off."

"It's enough though and God.. it feels good. It's spring, so the water is pretty cold."

"Eventually I settle on drifting to the bottom, laying and gripping on to the rocky floor as I stare up at the shimmery light above me."
"I feel the gentle current run over my body."
"It's nice to be away from all that tension above me. I feel isolated, alone, and for now, that feels good." 
"Only I could really come down this deep, the others not being able to hold their breath as long, or being too little."
"I remember when we were younger I would give the others \"rides\" around the lake, able to swim for nearly half a mile and back."
"Even Flynn the asshole had done it a few times. It was one skill I had that I was proud of, even if it was inherent to my species."
"It still made me somehow useful or at least different from everyone else...in a good way."
"I had always felt like the odd one out in the group, as strange as it sounds."
"Where everyone else has a strong, distinct personality, I was just.. average?"
"Sometimes I wonder if they were just friends with me because we all had to be when we were younger."
"This whole trip has kinda forced me to think back on all the memories I have of this place, and my friends."
"They were always doing the cool things, being different, while I just sort of blended into the background."
"Even then I wanted to DO something, to stand out somehow..."
"That's...that's what I'm trying to do here...I guess..."
"It's been about seven minutes, and I only know that because that's about as long as I can hold my breath."

"For a second, I wonder if everyone is just gone."
"Of course, that's ridiculous and, as I come over the embankment, everyone's there."
"Predictably, Flynn didn't get my food out, so I go to the cooler to grab a sandwich and soda before sitting in an empty chair next to Leo."
"Apparently it was a good idea to bring lawn chairs, considering the tables looked like they were covered in a year's worth of bird shit."
f "\"How was the swim?\""
"His tone is bitter and salty."
"He's not in his usual grumpy, but good-natured mood. He's genuinely unhappy."

"Memories are starting to flow back...TJ, Flynn thinking he'd done something...something to—"
"I stand up, as well."
"Flynn may sound like a hardass, but physically Leo had him beat...easily."
"Flynn can obviously tell that he might have a fight on his hands, though, and it's clear he doesn't want that."
"He drops his shoulders, seeming to shrink, as if invisible strings that had been holding him up were cut. He turns to us, then gestures at TJ."
