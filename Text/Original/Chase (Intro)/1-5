"As Leo and I come back into the room, I'm happy to see TJ talking to Flynn."  
"Their relationship was...complicated."
"While TJ and Flynn usually got along together, Flynn was a bit unpredictable with the lynx, and his random outbursts of dickishness often had TJ on edge."
"As of now, though, things were going alright."
c "\"TJ, I can't believe you're siding with him...End Game was the WORST Lion's Brigade movie!\""
f "\"You're just mad 'cuz they didn't follow the comics.\""
t "\"Yeah, Carl, as a movie it was just better...I'm sure the comics are great too, though, hehe.\""
f "\"Naw, the comics are shit. Carl tried showin' 'em to me once.\""
c "\"Bwah!!??\""
c "\"See?  This is the problem.  They never follow the source material and no one cares because they have no respect for the originals, man.\""
#Leo slides in
l "\"Heeey!\""
l "\"You guys talking about End Game? Great Movie!\""
c "\"Not you too, Leo!\""
"Flynn sneers as he watches me and Leo join the conversation."
f "\"Hey, the faggots are back!\""  
f "\"We got a bathroom, you know.  You don't have to go all the way out to the parking lot to make out!\""
"My face burns a little bit and Leo awkwardly clears his throat."
#Jenna slides in
j "\"Flynn, don't use that word.\""
f "\"Faggot?\""
f "\"Awww, they don't mind it. Tell her Chase.\""

#Love point for Flynn or Jenna
menu:
    "I always hated that word":
        "Back in the day, I might have been a little more lax, but at this point, I think Flynn should learn to be a bit more sensitive."
        c "\"Actually, Flynn, I'd rather you didn't.\""
        j "\"Thank you, Chase.\""
        f "\"What the hell?\""
        f "\"You never had a problem with it before.\""
        "I shrug.\""
        c "\"Things change, Flynn.\""
        f "\"Or maybe college just brainwashes you with social justice BS, huh?"
        j "\"Just drop it, Flynn.\""
        f "\"Fine.\""
    "I don't mind, it's just a word.":
        "A word's just a word."
        "Besides, Flynn's rolled around with plenty of guys in Payton."
        c "\"Oh, don't worry about it, Jenna. I don't mind.\""
        f "\"See? He doesn't mind at all!\""
        "Jenna sighs and pinches the bridge of her snout, shaking her head."
        j "\"Well I do.\""
        j "\"Please don't use it around me.\""
        f "\"Ugh, fine.\""
"Flynn usually listened to Jenna."
"He had a level of respect for her that he'd never given TJ."
j "\"It's a little ironic that you'd use that word, considering your preferences, Flynn.\""
f "\"I don't HAVE any preferences, actually. I just like to fuck.\""
j "\"Ugh...\""
"Flynn: a hedonist to a fault."
t "\"I don't know, I think Lion's Brigade was always a bit too violent for me, what with all the shooting and punching.\""
t "\"I've always liked the Trinity Weasel.  She's the thinking man's superheroine.\""
"The other three apparently haven't noticed our little squabble and continue talking."
"Carl waves his paw dismissively."
c "\"The Trinity comics have always been pretty lame.\""
c "\"They're jerk-off fodder for lonely nerds...and so's the movie.\""
l "\"Ha! You mean like yourself?\""
c "\"Hey...\""
f "\"Hold up, we're talking about Trinity now?\""
f "\"Julia Blasco...She's hella fine!\""
f "\"Never seen an ass like hers on a weasel before.\""
j "\"That's because it's fake.\""
t "\"N—no, I just like the story.\""
t "\"It's really kind of deep, if you think about it.\""
f "\"It was hard to think about when half the shots are slo-mo and she's doing all these flips and backbends and shit.\""
j "\"Come on, Trinity DOES have more story going on than your average superhero movie.\""
#Have Jenna's sprite move closer to TJ
"Looks like Jenna's coming to TJ's defense."
j "\"I think it's great that you like her character over all the meat-heads.\""
l "\"Yeah, they just stuck in all the boob shots to reel in the dummies like you, Flynn.\""
f "\"Of course that's easy for you to say. Besides, I see what's going on here.\""
f "\"Maybe you should watch Luche Lobo, TJ. He's shirtless the whole time.\""
f "\"I'd better stop it with all this saucy talk, don't you sproutin' your carrot!\""
"We all groan in unison."
"TJ keeps his head down for a few seconds, but when he lifts it I see a smirk spread across his muzzle."
t "\"You'd like to see that, wouldn't you, Flynn?\""
"There's a moment of silence before we all burst out laughing."
c "\"Daaaamn TJ, where'd that come from?\""
"It isn't that it is a particularly good joke."
"it's that it came from TJ that makes it so funny."
"I don't think I've ever heard him talk like that."
"Even Flynn can't keep from chuckling a little bit."
l "\"Alright, alright.\""
"Leo steps forward, indicating that we should all shut up."
l "\"Now, we all need to remember that Chase is here to do his school project, so that comes first.\""
l "\"But! I did make a few other plans for things that we can do on his off time.\""
l "\"I'm pretty sure all of us know that we're going to Southwest Adventures tomorrow, so I'll pick these two up—\""
"He jerks his head towards Flynn and Carl."
l "\"—then swing by the motel to get you guys at 9, alright?\""
j "\"Sounds good.\""
l "\"Then I was thinking about doing some stuff in Payton towards the end of the week, but we'll make those plans later.\""
l "\"In between those times we should find time to hang out as well, make the most of this.\""
"Leo looks about done, but suddenly snaps his fingers, as if remembering something."
l "\"Oh yeah! Chase, I saw you had a camera.\""
l "\"Think we could do a group pic? It would be nice for all of us to have something that isn't camera phone quality.\""
m "\"Oh, sure. I was messing with the self-timer earlier.\""
m "\"Should be able to get it to work.\""
"After a few minutes of me adjusting the tripod, and Leo adjusting everyone at the end of one of the beds, we manage to get into position."
m "\"Aaaalright, here goes...\""
"I set the timer and fast-walk to the spot Leo saved for me."
#Pic?
"For the next two hours we watch a movie on TV, not really paying attention, mostly catching up with each other on how we'd been."
"It's good to be back and it feels like we're all just picking up where we left off three years ago."
"It's really nice."
"Finally, at about 10, Leo, Carl, and Flynn head out."
"I spend the next twenty minutes tinkering with the equipment, making sure it was all in order for shooting the next day."
"Once TJ finishes getting ready for bed in the bathroom, I do as well before getting into bed, head-to-toe with TJ."
"There's a soft glow from the corner as Jenna sits at the table reading something."
"I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting for her to go to sleep..."
