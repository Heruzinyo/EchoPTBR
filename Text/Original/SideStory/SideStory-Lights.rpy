"I look down at the cup in my hand again, trying not to make eye contact with anyone around me."
"Part of me wished I had stayed home tonight, but Sarah asked me to come, and I’d feel bad turning her down."
"She looked so excited when she mentioned how much effort she and the rest of her bible group put into this party."
"She'd said that after a recent string of storms, the school wanted people to know that there was a severe weather shelter in the basement of the church."
"At first I thought it was going to be a bland-looking concrete basement, but as it turns out, Payton's old school gym is beneath the church."
"It's a small basketball court with bleachers that fold back against the walls and old basketball rims that are pulled up towards the ceiling so that they're out of the way."
"Sarah and her friends strung up streamers and lights along with all sorts of other party decorations, turning this drab old gymnasium into a pretty cool party room."
"A disco ball hangs from the ceiling, reflecting lights over the room, while a DJ stands off to the side taking requests for which songs to play."
"So far, mostly 80s and 90s pop songs."
"A group of adults stand around the DJ, probably to make sure nothing too risqué is played."
"Almost all of us are standing around talking or avoiding eye contact, save for a few adventurous souls dancing awkwardly next to one another."
"I finish off the last of my drink and decide to head back over to the punch bowl."
"I keep my head down, avoiding eye contact, as I walk through the crowd."
"I reach the refreshments table and ladle more juice into my cup, and sigh to myself."
"I really shouldn't have come here tonight. My parents are out of town for the weekend, and I had to ask Chase and Leo for a ride."
"I figured since they were already heading to Payton tonight it would be alright, but something about their mood made me think that I had ruined their night."
"I told them that I'd try to find a ride home with someone else and that I'd call them if there were any changes, but they said not to bother."
"Chase said that they'd stick around, that \"it's not like they had anything better to do.\""
"The way he said it made me realize I'd made a mistake bringing them into this."
"I can't take my mind off of it now. I tried to make Sarah's night a little better, but ended up ruining Chase and Leo's."
"Now I'm avoiding Sarah, and I can't help but feel I'm ruining everyone's night."
"I have to stop myself from thinking about it too much."
"I bring my cup to my lips and drink just so that I’m doing something, if only for a few seconds."
"I end up downing all of it, and I close my eyes."
"I focus on slowing my breathing to stave off a panic attack I feel coming on. It takes a few minutes, but finally I can feel my heart rate slow and my body relax."
"Only to be startled by a hand touching my shoulder."
sa "\"Hey.\""
t "\"Hey!\""
"My voice is squeaky. She smiles a little at that."
sa "\"I was hoping to find you here. I was looking for you earlier, but I got caught up with Jessica and Amber.\""
"Her eyes dart around and she blushes."
sa "\"Would you like to dance?\""
"I can't help the shocked expression that I'm sure is on my face, and my eyes dart to the ground."
"I start mumbling out an excuse before Sarah reaches for my hand and pulls me to the dance floor."
"The cup I’m holding slips from my hand as I lose track of myself. Everything seems to fade away as I follow Sarah onto the dance floor."

"She turns to me and pulls me closer and places my hand on her hip. I hope the music is loud enough to mask the gulp I make when my hand touches her dress."
"Sarah is wearing an off-white sundress with a red ribbon around her waist and I can’t help but stare with how cute she looks."
"I feel over-dressed in my outfit. My mom had laid out my clothes for me before she and Dad left. A light blue dress shirt and tie paired with slacks."
"Sarah's smile snaps me out of my reminiscing as she waits for me to take the lead."
"I force myself out of my trance and take a tentative step... right onto Sarah's foot."
"She squeaks and pulls her foot away."
t "\"Sorry! Sorry...\""
"Sarah just giggles at me while my face burns."
"There are a few more missteps before we get a rhythm down, and I can't help but feel kinda good about myself."
"At least I still have a chance at making Sarah's night and not completely ruining it."
"Her smile seems to have a way of relaxing my nerves, and soon enough I'm smiling back at her."
"The next song has a faster tempo and we let go of each other. Sarah shakes her hips and moves her body to match the beat."
"I fumble, not knowing what to do with my hands, so I start to copy Sarah and hope she doesn’t notice."
"We dance together, laughing and occasionally singing lyrics to songs we both know."

"Every now and then we bump into each other, which forces a few laughs out of us; although I’m suspicious that she’s doing it on purpose."
"Before long the tempo of the music starts to slow and we find ourselves slow dancing once again."
"Sarah pulls herself closer to me this time until our bodies press together, she looks me in the eye and smiles warmly, before putting her head on my shoulder."
"My body tenses and I can feel her breath warm against me. I can feel her body press into me as she hugs me tighter."

"It feels nice."
"In that moment I realize just how much Sarah enjoys my friendship. I feel like she trusts me."
"It's been so long since I've felt this comfortable around anyone, not even Jenna or the others make me feel like this."
"I haven't felt safe around anyone in such a long time, even my own friends."
"But with Sarah, it's as if I can let my guard down. I feel like I could do no wrong to her."
"I gently pull her into me, returning her embrace and smile."
"Unfortunately, my body reacts to this in the worst way possible and my smile fades as I feel my pants getting tighter."

"We start to step out of sync and I can feel her torso grind against mine, I can feel her press her hips into mine."
"I tense and try to pull my hips away but that only succeeds in making matters worse as the angle changes and I can feel myself bumping into her."
"Sarah's hands travel down my back, coming to a rest just above my tail."
"My entire body is tense and I can feel myself starting to panic before the song fades out for another with a faster tempo."
"Sarah pulls her head from my shoulder."
sa "\"I love this song!\""
"She pulls away and I feel a wave of relief wash over me, hoping she didn't notice or isn't angry about what happened."
"She starts to bounce and hop to the beat and I follow her lead, but she turns around and pushes her back into me."
"She gives me a wink over the shoulder, and as she dances, her body grinds against mine."
"She sways her body while I try to focus on dancing, but I can't keep up."
"I try to move along with her but I keep moving the wrong way. I can feel my crotch grind against her body."
"Panicking, I take a step back, and she follows me."

sa "\"Thanks for dancing with me, TJ.\""
"Even in the dim lighting I can see her blushing face."
sa "\"I'm going to take a break, but I want to dance with you again before the party ends, okay?\""
t "\"O-okay.\""
"I watch as she walks away, not realizing my eyes are on her hips until she disappears into the crowd."
