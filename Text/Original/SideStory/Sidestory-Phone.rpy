"I pull up to the old fast food joint in my shitty old truck, the fan blasting hot desert air."
"I look around the sunbaked parking lot, but I don't see Chase's car, yet."
"Taking out my phone, I check the time and scan through my messages. He told me he got out for lunch fifteen minutes ago, but it's twenty minutes later, now."
"There's a little pang of worry, mostly because I know how shitty a driver Chase is, but he's usually late, so I quash that."
"I give my pits a quick check."
"Driving around with a broken AC is fucking torture in this weather, but the antiperspirant seems to be holding up alright."
"After giving them a quick sniff I recline and put my paws behind my head to air out and maybe catch a quick nap."
"Sure, it's a pain in the ass having to come down here when I'm this tired."
"Dad's working me to the goddamn bone, and the restaurant is on the opposite side of Payton!"
"But seeing Chase makes it worth it."
"It isn't often that we get to have lunch together. The lunch hour being as short as it is only gives us about 20 minutes to really talk."
"I'm starting to doze off when I hear a knock on my window."
"I give a little start and open my eyes, squinting against the desert sun reflecting off a car bumper in front of me."

"Looking to my left, Chase's adorable otter face greets me through the window, grinning."
"All of the bad mood I had earlier evaporates away, as if it were water under this fucking sun, and Chase steps back as soon as I open the door."
l "\"Hey, babe.\""
"I step out and pull him into a hug."
m "\"Hey.\""
"He says it against my chest, rubbing his nose in like he always does while I run my paws around his back."
l "\"Man, that swim team is really slimming you down.\""
"I pinch his sides appreciatively."
"He wiggles under my fingers and returns the favor to my own waist."
m "\"And you're getting squishy.\""
l "\"Hey!\""
"I pretend to be offended, giving him a mock growl, letting it vibrate from my chest into his nose."
l "\"Wouldn't be that way if you didn't keep picking fat factories like this.\""
l "\"...No more football doesn't help either.\""
m "\"I like it.\""
"I'm actually really proud of him right now."
"He used to be so worried about people seeing us like this, but now he's hugging me like no one's around."
"I decide to go a bit further and give him a quick lick on one of those stubby, cute ears and he gives a little shiver and laughs."
m "\"Stooop. Let's go inside. It's too hot out here.\""

"As he turns away from me he lets his thick tail push up against my crotch, shoving my junk up against my body."
"It actually hurts more than it feels good (he really doesn't get how strong that thing is) but it gets me going anyway."

"But Chase seems to be in a good mood. It's probably as good a time as any."

m "\"Don't worry about it right now, Leo. I've still got a few months to decide.\""
"Fuck. How can he not worry when all that's gonna do is make ME worry?"
"And the way he says it... it sounds like he's already made a decision."

"I grunt and he heads off towards the back of the restaurant while I slump in my seat."
"The idea of Chase leaving is fucking terrifying."
"We've been this way for the past two and a half years and the way he's treating this decision like it's just a fucking annoyance makes me all the more frustrated."
"I feel like this relationship has only really come into its own over the past year."
"Mostly because Chase turned eighteen and we don't have to worry about the stupid shit anymore."
