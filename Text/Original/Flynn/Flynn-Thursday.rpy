"Sneaking around behind Leo's back like this is wrong, even if I know telling him about it would be worse."

"If I sneak to the bathroom real quick I can grab my clothes."
"Maybe stay there until Leo leaves."
"At least that way it won't look as bad if he finds me for whatever reason."
"I get up and pad quietly to the hall, listening."

"The kitchen is practically out of sight from the hall, which leads to the living room."

"I look around desperately. realizing that I don't have much time."

"It's a see-through blue color so there's no way I can stand behind it and not be seen."
"I hear shifting around in the other room again and their bickering becomes more clear as they step back into the hall."
"Panicking and practically numb with fear, I crouch down and pull open a cupboard under the sink."
"Amazingly, there are only a few bottles of cleaning solutions, leaving plenty of room for me to squeeze in."
"As quietly as I can, I crawl into the opening."

        "Said folder also notes a work order for the installation of rebar bars in the mine front to prevent entry in 1976."
        "Next, there's the actual lawsuit documentation itself."
        "The lawsuit contributed, in part, to the official closing of the mine during the war in 1942."
        "The working conditions were abysmal, and the owners of the mine were also heavily involved in town government, so there were corruption charges."
        "The Danicka Mine, also known as the CSCG (Coppersilvercoalgold) Mine, was the most in-demand employer in the northern portion of-"
        "-this state for decades. This was in little part due to management by the owners, but rather the natural conditions of the mine itself."
        "The structure of the bedrock kept cave-ins unlikely, and its chemical composition kept the temperature stable and somewhat bearable."
        "Flooding was of minor concern due to the low water table of the region."
        "In other mines within the state, miners may have been expected to stand in two feet of dirty water in 40 degree temperatures, -"
        "-all while the threat of a cave-in loomed, amplified with every strike of the sledgehammer."
        "Yet even still, the mine managed to have one of the highest casualty rates for its workers in all the southwest."
        "The suit argues that this was at root due to severe negligence by the owner, Gregory Briggs."
        "Miners were required to buy their own tools, including candles, sledges, picks, stakes, and even dynamite."
        "Their wages, however, were of such little amount that many miners must have been forced to choose between having these tools, and their family being-"
        "- able to eat that week."
        "Many chose the latter, as most men who moved to Echo did so with the explicit purpose of being able to provide for said families."
        "Briggs operated the mine under constant fear of worker unionization. To assuage this, he hired an incredibly nationally diverse assortment of workers."
        "His rationale, though denied in court, was to ensure that no group of workers spoke the same language, thus reducing the chance of collaboration-"
        "- for better working conditions or wages."
        "This preventative action was particularly heinous due to the nature of the work itself."
        "Communication was crucial, especially in the low-light conditions of the lower depths."

                "He says something I can't quite understand thanks to his drunken slur."

"He busted out of there and drove off all high-tail like."
"While making his way down Route 65, he swerved and hit a pole."
"The impact would have killed him if he weren't so thick-skulled."
"And of course, he told his dear-old-parents about it and they took the blame for everything."
"They didn't want him to be tested when the cops showed."
"It wasn't until a couple months ago he told me, in his drug-addled mind, he thought he had driven to Pueblo and picked up Chase."
"Carl claimed he was talking to him the whole ride-back, telling him how college life was going and shit."
"Stroking his horns, mentioning how he missed him, and wanted him back as a roommate."
"You know, all the shit Chase never actually said after Carl dropped out."
"The fucker barely even responded to his messages."
"He could have sworn when he swerved off the road and struck the pole, he killed Chase - crushed somehow at impact."
"He wouldn't stop shaking."
"I made a joke that I would have helped him bury the body."
