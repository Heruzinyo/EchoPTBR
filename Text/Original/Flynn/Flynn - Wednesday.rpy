"Leo tries to coax me to go along, but I mumble something about needing to finish my project."
"The next thing I know, it's an hour later and the motel room is empty."
"I chastise myself for the late start I'm getting and roll out of bed, skipping a shower and instead gathering up all of my equipment."

"It's broken down and vandalized to hell, which looks great through the camera."
"The original Echo School was built back in the early 1900s, but it was torn down and rebuilt in the 50s."
"That's the building that I'm looking at now."
"Apparently, all grades were combined into this one building which was sectioned off by three floors—"
"\"Echo Elementary\", \"Echo Jr. High\", and \"Echo High\"."
"After 1980, there were too few students to keep it functional and they started busing everyone to Payton instead, closing Echo School down."
"It's a two story brick school house with a basement and about 30 rooms inside."
"I remember my parents saying that after it closed down it was a rite of passage to sneak into the school at night and graffiti up the walls."
"Basically everyone drew a pentagram."

"I set the camera up to get a few shots of the outside of the school, making sure to emphasize the graffiti on the front and avoid the white soccer goal."
"Apparently Echo was still putting the field to use."
"The windows are foggy and though there are dozens of squares of glass missing, it's pitch black inside."
"I calculate in my mind how long I'll be speaking over this portion of the footage, realizing that it probably won't be longer than ten or fifteen seconds."
"I feel a little flair of annoyance at the thought of how much I'm putting into this and how little I'm getting out."
"I wonder if this is really the kind of thing I want to be doing and not for the first time."
"After about half an hour of trying different angles, I finally straighten up, wiping my forehead."
"The sun is up to the point of warming the top of my head and I know that within a half hour I'll be burning up."
"I start packing up my camera when I feel a different sensation on the top of my head."
"A slight pressure and a prickle - the feeling that I'm being watched."
"I look back up at the school building."
"It's quiet, broken and stoic, like it has been for the past few decades."
"Still, my eyes are drawn to the second floor, specifically to the window on the far right."
"I stare hard at it, narrowing my eyes."
"Behind the glass, in the dark room, something curves out from the right side of the window."
"It's a lighter color and it stands out in stark contrast against the black of the rest of the windows."
"It could be anything, really, but as I stare at it I get the same vibes from it as I do from Carl's horns."
"I stare at it, waiting to see if it moves, morbidly imagining a face peering around the corner at any moment."
"Picturing Carl suddenly jumping out to stare at me from the window is kind of funny..."
"...but also creepy because I can't imagine what he'd be doing up there."
"The hairs on the back of my neck stand up and I look around, kind of hoping that someone might be nearby."
"It's deserted, of course, my only company being the sunbaked road and dried sagebrush."
"I turn my attention back to that spot next to the window, half-expecting the maybe-a-horn to be gone."
"It's still there, though, not having shifted at all from when I first spotted it."
"I shift the strap of the camera bag onto my shoulder and stand up straight before moving a little closer to the building, next to the doors for a better look."
"Maybe...maybe it's the handle to something."
"Maybe it's the handle of an old watering can, maybe for a class project forgotten long ago."
"...Maybe."
"I shrug off the feeling and turn to leave."

"As his tail slides out of the rear, I move my hands around to feel his ass as the pants slide further down."
"His thick tail twitches in response before I squeeze his soft rear, earning a gasp from the lizard."
"I'm so preoccupied with his backside that I almost forget the front."
"That's when the pants finally drop to the floor and I find myself face to face with Flynn's cock."
"I almost go cross-eyed staring at the tapered tip."
"I hear the lizard chuckle above me as he sways his hips, bobbing his length in front of my nose."
f "\"What's that face? It's like you've never seen a dick be—UNGH!\""
"I clamp my muzzle around it, egged on by Flynn's teasing."
"His hands immediately go to my head, steadying himself as he finally shuts up."
"I take it all in, almost gagging on the length."
"Leo is the only other guy I've blown and he's basically the opposite compared to Flynn."
"While he was shorter and thicker, what's in my mouth now is long and thin."
"I start to bob my head back and forth, suddenly self-conscious, worried that a pro like Flynn might see me for the complete amateur that I am."
"His reaction, though, says otherwise."
"He grunts and groans, hips bucking and pressing into my mouth each time I pull back."
"I look up at his face and I'm surprised to see him looking right back down at me."
"His eyes are slits, his mouth hanging open as he gasps."
"I blush and look back down, focusing instead on his lithe stomach, his faint abs standing out just a bit more with each thrust."
"For the next five minutes the only sound is the gasping breaths from the lizard and the occasional thump of my head against the door."
"Flynn breathlessly apologizes each time."
"As it goes on, though, I can feel the muscles in his legs starting to tense up."
f "\"F—fuck, it's comin'...do you...do you want me to pull out?\""
"Flynn must be pent-up. It always took Leo at least ten minutes before he came from a blow-job, if at all."
"I feel Flynn tense and start to step back, but I slide my hands up his thighs, squeeze his ass again, keeping him firmly in place."
"If Flynn is still trying to pull back he runs out of time because I feel his length jump in my mouth."
f "\"Oh...fuuuuuuck.\""
"Flynn doubles over me sharply, his head slamming against the door as I take him in all the way and start sucking."
"His thin body shakes against me and I try not to smirk as I feel his clawed feet brush my knees as they dance around in ecstasy."
"I glance up at him again and see the top of his head and a hand pressed to the door."
"His eyes are squeezed shut and his teeth are bared as he hisses through them."
"His other hand is gripping tightly into my head fur and with each suck he grips tighter."
"After about three spurts, his twitching dick finally settles on my tongue."
"While Flynn is definitely quicker to come, it isn't quite as much as Leo, so I have no trouble getting it all down."
