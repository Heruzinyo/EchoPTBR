"Carl has tied the spinner in a giant, ugly, knot, the string sticking out in every which way."
f "\"This is why I told you to fuckin' wait.\""
"I guess Carl had gotten impatient and decided to tie his own lure while Flynn helped me with mine."
"Flynn takes out a knife from his pocket and takes the spinner from Carl, scowling."
f "\"I'd throw this away if I didn't have so fuckin' few of 'em. What's wrong with you, Carl?\""

f "\"That's not the point—\""
"Flynn almost growls, prodding and poking at the messy knot."

"He finally seems to get a handle on the mess and starts tugging out line."
f "\"And how am I gonna relax with you fuckin' everything up?\""

"I come up empty and cast the line out again, listening to the clicking whir of the reel before the spinner lands with a plop in the middle of the pond."
"I was wondering where Flynn would go to fish since we wouldn't go to Emma, obviously."
"Turns out he and Leo found this pond twenty minutes outside of town, deep into the wilderness."
"Unsurprisingly, no one comes here, which is why Flynn says the fishing is good."
"There definitely is something calming about being out in the middle of nowhere, especially with the repetitive motions of fishing to keep you occupied."
"Finally, Flynn finishes showing Carl how to cast and the ram launches his spinner out, almost all the way to the other side of the pond."

f "\"Grab it above the reel post, here—\""
"He holds the rod, then grabs my paw and slides it up the pole."

"If I really did want to catch a fish, though, I would be swimming in the water right now."

"Again, it's a huge relief to be back in the water and I drift towards the bottom. It's not deep at all and the water here has a slimy feel that I don't like."
"Still, it's better than nothing and I undulate slowly across the pond."
"It doesn't take long to reach the log as it's only about 30 feet away."
"I have to bob a few times to the surface to look around, though, since the water's too murky to see through."
"I'm actually kinda starting to regret doing this. I try to remember if I have any cuts or sores I'm gonna have to douse in peroxide later."

"It comes out easily and I carefully lift it, making sure I'm out of the way of the hook in case Carl decides to yank the line again."

"It's at that point that I see a silver flash to the right of my field of vision."
"I look over and see a fish, swimming lazily over some plant life on the bottom of the pond."
"I pause and would have smiled if my mouth wasn't going to fill with pond water."
"It would be funny, after all this time with their lures and their poles, for me to just pop out of the water, fish in paw."
"I swim over to it slowly, lingering to the side so I won't block the sunlight before diving down and snatching it up."
"I latch in my claws to keep it from escaping as I give a little wiggle of delight."
"It's been a long time since I've done this, but it looks like I've still got it."
"I turn and start swimming back to Flynn and Carl and that's when I suddenly feel like I'm being watched."

"It's not the typical feeling, though. This is much, much more intense..."
"I pause and look back over my shoulder, then forward again."
"It's pointless because everything's cloudy, I can't see more than ten feet."
"I've sunk down to the bottom of the pond, both of my feet resting in deep muck as I crouch, trying to figure out where the feeling is coming from."
"It doesn't help that my head is starting to buzz, a tone building in my head that sounds like an orchestra tuning."
"I haven't been down that long...I shouldn't be running out of air."
"Of course, I should just swim up to the surface, where it's bright and safe, but I don't, because this feels too familiar."
"I think back to when I was twelve, playing in the abandoned school with Carl."
"I was hiding from him, in a second-floor classroom when I felt this exact feeling."
"Intense, almost physical, like a hand was grabbing into the back of my neck."
"I look around again, then finally look down, at the fish in my paws."
"And now I know where it's coming from."
"Before I know it I'm whipping upwards, breaking through the surface in less than a second and swimming towards my friends."

"I'm frozen that way, paws against the passenger window as I stare in shock through it at the truck's steering wheel, though I'm not really seeing it."
"There's a pause and I think it's because he's waiting for my response, to see if I'd tell him to stop or not."
"I don't, though, and I lean my head back into his neck, feeling my entire body break out into goosebumps as he rubs at my chest."
f "\"You like that, don't you?\""
"I respond with a gasp as his sharp teeth graze across one of my stubby ears, his hot breath sending another wave of chills over my skin."
"His hands slide back down, slowly, feeling out my body."
f "\"Actin' like a little slut. You didn't think this was gonna happen?\""
"I stiffen a little under the remark and lift my tail up again, between his legs."
m "\"You're one to fucking talk.\""

        "It had always been Flynn's soft spot."
        "Not just physically. It's also a really sensitive spot for him. I found this out years ago when I first tickled him."

        "Flynn's biceps flex as he struggles with my hold, which must have been an act because he sure as hell couldn't have broken the pin if he tried." 
        "His playful struggling only gets me more excited." 
        "My sheath is filling rapidly now, and I can see his pants are fully tented. He sighs breathily and relents as I keep my hold firm, continuing to tease his belly."

        "I take advantage of him being at my height level, and glide my wet tongue over the slick scales of his neck."
        "His whole body gives a weird little jump, his hands snapping up to grab my arms, almost painfully, but he doesn't push me away."
        "I give a little grunt of annoyance and shrug off his hands, bringing my own paws back to his front."
        "Dragging my blunt claws along his stomach, I trail them to around his back, scritching into his scales"
        "Flynn rasps, letting out another reptilian moan. I can't help but giggle, pressing my body into the euphoric lizard."
        "He tilts his head back, eyes half-lidded, and maw agape, his tongue flicking at the air."
        "For a moment, I realize exactly what I'm doing; making out with my childhood friend. Strange as it seems, it's sexy as hell."
        "A few years ago there was no way I'd be okay with this. I guess the time apart, along with being pent up for a few days, helped to spur me on."
        "I'm nearly fully out of my sheath at this point, my cock pressing into his very tented pants crotch."
        "He pulls me in, and I undulate against him, grinding into his crotch with my own"
        "Riding out the reptile's spasms, I smooth my paw pads down his back, dipping below his pants' belt line, under his boxer briefs."
        "Again, I grab two pawfuls of naked gila ass, clasping Flynn's butt on either side of his short, fat tail."

        "Flynn's not too bad with his hands. I wanna see what he does."
        "Flynn pauses for a second, as if he's having second thoughts, but after a while he goes on."
        f "\"Damn, you're fuckin' hot.\""
        "He rubs my stomach, which I suck in, and I have to keep from whimpering as one of his fingers teases at my belly button."
        f "\"I like skinny guys...is that just a natural part of being an otter? I can tell you don't work out.\""
        m "\"Hey I—I still have to keep in shape...I swim...\""
        "I can't go on as he breathes into my ear again, making me gasp and lean my head back, biting my lip."
        f "\"Hehe, sensitive ears, huh?\""
        "Finally, he gets to my lower stomach and he pauses, waiting again for my response."
        "Again, I don't say anything, instead pushing my butt back into his crotch and thighs."
        "One of his pinky fingers prods gently at the top of my sheath."
        "Suddenly he lets go from cupping my stomach to cup my balls, pushing the furry sack up against my body."
        "I gasp loudly, eyes wide as I feel my sheath filling up as his thumb prods at my nuts."
        "There's something mind-blowingly bizarre about having one of my childhood friends groping me like this and it's got me all kinds of confused."
        "Three years ago, just before I left, this would have been insane. No way in hell would I have been okay with it."
        "But now...something about the time we'd been apart, has made all of this okay..."
        "...and incredibly hot."
        "I think not having any sort of release over the past few days has something to do with it."
        "Flynn suddenly lets go, then grabs me by the shoulder and turns me around roughly."
        "Once my back is pressed firmly against his truck, he grabs my wrists and pins them up by my head."
        "With my body fully exposed, he looks me over, a hungry look in his eyes."
        "I just stand there, feeling vulnerable under his gaze, especially when he gets to my junk."
        "I get harder just with him looking at it."
        "His eyes flick back up to mine and I look back at him...then I give him a smirk."
        "Flynn sneers back and suddenly his head dives in."
        "I have just a second to gasp before I feel his muzzle close around my neck, and I freeze, fur standing up all over my body."
        "Flynn gently undulates his head, getting his teeth past the thick fur on my neck to prick at the skin underneath."
        "I stare at the sky, mouth hanging open as I clutch at his chest, feeling the chuckle past his pecs as he keeps me pinned."
        "Then he presses his thick, strong tongue through my fur to tease at the flesh, pressing against the pulse in my neck."
        "My knees go weak and I sag against the truck, letting out a loud, gasping whimper."
        "This spurs the lizard on and he lets out another chuckle, doing it again, clearly wanting me to make more noises."
        "How the hell did he know all my weak spots?"
        "For some reason I start to wonder if he's talked to Leo about me, and that brings up all kinds of complications I don't want to think about right now."
        "I shove it to the back of my mind."
        "Besides, I know Flynn's weak spots, too."
        "Flynn brings down my right paw from its position against the window, which is fine because it was starting to fall asleep..."
        "...but then he presses it against his stomach."
        "He's warm and soft, his leathery hide sliding smoothly along the muscles of his belly."
        "It's clear he doesn't work out, either, but I'm okay with that."
        "I press against him and he gives a slight huff through his nostrils."
        "Then he starts to slide my paw lower, past the waistband of his pants, under his boxers."
        "I can't see what's going on, since he's still got his mouth against my neck."
        "That's when I feel something hot and smooth against my finger tips—"

"I grin, feeling mischievous."
"Wrapping my paw around Flynn's rock-solid member, I give a brisk, smooth pump."
"He moans, practically melting over me now, his muzzle in the crook of my neck. And I think I feel him..."
"...drooling down my back?"
f "\"Shit... Unh... you must've been a handful for wolfy-boy. He's not the type to easily submit.\""
"Flynn's right. Leo was a stubborn boyfriend, in and out of the bedroom."
"With a lot of coaxing I could eventually get him to see things my way, but that hardly ever happened."
"I had a lot more energy as a teenager, more...zest, I guess?"
"It's hard to explain, but over the years I've just become more...well, exactly what Flynn's accused me of being."
"Personally, I just chalk it up to growing up."
"But, right now, I do sort of feel like my old self, and that's kind of incredible."
m "\"Hey, I'm a versatile otter. I like to trade off.\""
